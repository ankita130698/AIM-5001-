You know what... I'm about to go listen to some J Cole. ,delusional-tde,1,KendrickLamar,0,"Kendrick and Drake is wasting our time...

Kendrick needs actual receipts 

(Drake only denying the daughter part is somewhat telling , why not just say he's lying about everything?)

But until then Drake dropped the better track and he's winning.  Kendrick played it too casual. 

Drake just potentially dropped a hit and the angle Kendrick came back with that slow track. He has to bring real proof to the table. 

If anything he should've released Meet The Grahams within 6:16 in LA

Anyway. Congrats Drake.  ",05-04-2024
When my partner and I objectify each other in bed,Ok_One2418,1,AskWomenNoCensor,1,"My bf and I have a real big kink for being super objectifying in bed and I was wondering if this sort of thing is normal. For example we'll cheekily call each other a slut (our own personal slut) or sometimes a whore, talk down to one another, and we'll slap the shit out of eachother and just order eachother around, it gets pretty kinky. He gets off on me slapping him, or biting his lip really hard until it bleeds a bit. We'll grab each other's throat and try to dominate one another, stuff like this. At the same time we are also crazy in love and call eachother our soulmate, so we completely respect one another.   
Is this sort of behaviour normal? None of my friends are really like this with their partner. ",05-04-2024
Maturity.,TheLowlyPoet,1,Poems,0,"Maturity is often likened to age. ‘In just a few years they’ll grow out of that stage.’ 
Maturity is often likened to reasons. ‘They’ll live, and they’ll learn, then grow out of that season.’
Maturity is often likened to time. For ‘they’ll learn to grow out of that before they die.’
Maturity’s often likened to raising. ‘They learned that one young and don’t know how to play it.’ 

But truly I say to the lies aforementioned, maturity’s nothing of all above sentence. 

Maturity’s like when you’re stabbed while you’re bleeding but you understand different context and meaning. 
Maturity’s like when your life pushes you. But you don’t push back with the things you’ve been through. 
Maturity’s like when there’s hard complications, you don’t resent but present conversation. 
Maturity’s like all the fruit of your spirit. You’ll sit and you’ll listen though you don’t wanna hear it. 

What I mean to say is it’s not found in age, it’s not found in a magic development stage. It’s something that takes a self-wandering find. 
Maturity’s built between your heart and your mind. ",05-04-2024

"Find this fic! ""Every follicle""",edieblake17,1,drarry,0,"Hiya! 

Looking for a drarry fic Set post epilogue. 
There's a recurring phrase in it of Harry saying to Lily how much he loves her. ""[I love you.. down to]every follicle""

Ive put the rest under spoilers because I can't remember how much isn't/is revealed in the fic summary/tags. 

>!Harry dies but goes to become part of a team of reapers; they're disguised as just random people. 
They have to touch a person to collect their soul right before their death occurs.  If they try to connect with loved ones who are still alive, they lose a memory. 
Draco had previously died and is a reaper too, and they basically set up a life together in the in-between; turned out they'd had a fling once, but at the time Harry chose Ginny and a family instead. 
Harry leaves little messages and things to Lily, and The fic ends where she puts flowers or something on his grave and finds a note from him that says ""every follicle""!<

Seven Adani group firms say received SEBI show-cause notices,Firm_Resident3315,1,IndianStocks,0,"**Good morning, everyone.**

Let's dive into the latest news from the Adani Group:

Seven firms under the Adani Group have found themselves in the spotlight as they received show cause notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Here are the key details:

1. **Notice Recipients:** Adani Enterprises, the flagship company, revealed receiving two show cause notices from SEBI during the January-March 2023 quarter. Additionally, five other Adani firms—Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar—declared similar notices.
2. **Reason for Notices:** SEBI initiated investigations into alleged violations concerning related party transactions and non-compliance with listing regulations, prompted by allegations from U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
3. **Business Impact:** While the notices raise concerns, the Adani Group firms have assured that they will not significantly impact their business operations.
4. **Political Ramifications:** This development has sparked renewed political tensions between the opposition Congress party and the ruling BJP regarding the perceived relationship between the Adani Group and the government.

**Summary:** The issuance of show cause notices by SEBI to seven Adani Group firms underscores the regulatory scrutiny surrounding their corporate governance practices and related party transactions. While these notices do not represent final judgments, they reflect SEBI's thorough examination in response to allegations raised against the Adani Group.",05-04-2024

Snoring itself isn’t the issue - a lot of the time you can’t really do anything about it.
But chances are you didn’t just start to snore, and you’ve probably known about it for years…and you decide to share a room with a dozen other strangers, half of whom have jet lag and just want to sleep? Why would you subject them to that?

I don’t blame Arrowhead for the actions forced upon them by Sony I blame both of them,Roughpatch420,1,helldivers2,0,"Arrowhead didn’t make the decision, but they have made no indication whatsoever that they even tried to do anything about it. I understand that you can’t say no to your publisher, but you can sure af negotiate. Cut a deal with them and make it optional in countries PSN is banned, or make it optional for everyone however that might be asking too much. They could’ve made the game unavailable to players in those countries, but they didn’t because they wanted money and didn’t care who it affected. If nothing else when the requirement was lifted they should’ve explained more clearly that this was temporary and that those that cannot create an account or don’t want to to refund the game or not purchase it. Instead they’re just saying over and over again that it’s not their fault and we should take it up with Sony and won’t even apologize.

I have a PlayStation account, might even already have it linked with steam, but I still take a huge issue with this. Everyone complaining about the security issues with Sony should just shut tf up all it does is distract from the real issue here, look up any major tech company older than 10 years and there’s probably a bunch of data breaches and you sure af weren’t whining about it when God of War and Uncharted came to steam. The issue here is that arrowhead had the power to mitigate this issue so only a handful or possibly none of the players would’ve been affected and are taking zero responsibility for not doing so. 

Sony fucked up and they deserve most of the hate, but Arrowhead stood silent and watched people buy their game in countries they knew wouldn’t be able to play it once this change went through and said nothing. If they were ignorant of this upcoming change I could see them being blameless, but they knew this would happen sooner or later and didn’t say anything about it. That is the issue here, it’s the developers standing idly by while Sony cuts off a major portion of the player base, that they probably won’t give any a refund, and that their response has to this has been nothing, but indignant comments about it not being their fault with a link to Sony’s support page like we’re a joke to them.",05-04-2024

Issue with multiple clients no longer able to connect to home Wireguard Server,Hefty_Ad5984,1,WireGuard,0,"I have multiple profiles created on my Wireguard server on the Glinet MT3000 Beryl. I’ve had successful connections with all the profiles. Then I enabled DDNS on the Beryl and was still successful in connecting to the server. I didn’t use it for about 2 days and now when I try to connect it doesn’t work with any of the client profiles. So I thought it may be the DDNS address I replaced my IP with so I removed it and added back my IP. It’s not connecting. I tried deleting the tunnel and rescanning the QR code to add a tunnel back on my phone Wireguard app — still no success. I read elsewhere some people said time syncing resolved the issue? I went to check the time zone and it was accurate time listed on the router. Also, there’s another Wireguard server I have in another area that I setup for backup purposes, which also I can’t connect. I don’t often connect to this server so I didn’t think it would suddenly fail given there are no internet outages. I had someone even restart that router/server and I still can’t connect to it. It’s been months. So now I’m just curious if there is like a time limit? Or what causes the client to server connection to suddenly fail when no changes are made? Sorry for the long rant.

36 [M4F] #Chicago - Vocal British Daddy Dom loves a naughty little good girl...,John_be33,1,r4r,0,"About me: 36 M, 6’0”, in great shape, living in Chicago. I'm a British transplant and still maintain my posh, British, gentleman's accent (I do also enjoy sending short voice notes).
  
About you: Little does anyone know, you are a closet bad girl. You crave nothing more than to be used like a toy by a dominant Daddy type. You want to be used day after day. You get off on being called a good girl and crave being used in front of your big mirror and told what to do. You want to be slowly stripped in front of your big mirror and slowly edged. It's just so dirty, isn't it. So tawdry. Allowing yourself to be seduced by a dominant man and falling under his spell as you just melt into your fantasy role as his mewling, obedient sex pet. His plaything. You don't want just sex, you want to feel owned. Controlled. Tamed. Docile and obedient, subservient. When you’re bent over for me, that pretty hair will just be a handle for me to yank back to remind you who is in complete control of you.  
  
Because let's face it, that boyfriend of yours doesn't know what you really need, does he? And that collar really does feel so right around your neck now, doesn't it pet?  

I'm married here, but in a dead bedroom situation so looking to meet my needs elsewhere.
  
More about me: I work in finance but my calling is being a daddy dom. I crave nothing more than having my good girl. I think about her often as I sit in my office behind closed doors. Outside of work I enjoy a good glass of Pimm's, shopping for silk ties, and CrossFit. You might have seen me along the lakeshore path if you go there on Saturdays.  
  
Kinks: spanking, orgasm control, light bondage, edging, deep throating, slight degradation, breath play, pulling your hair, role play.

For context, I had to have right ovary removed due to a massive ovarian cyst rupture. Basically trying to safe ol' lefty by suppressing ovulation since this is how the cysts form!

19M I'll probably like you.,Kwikis1,1,LetsChat,0,"I like people. I like good people, bad people, good-bad people and bad-good people. With all their flaws and imperfections. Their attitudes and their ideals. I know a lot of people. Coworkers, friends, classmates, acquaintances. But it's not enough to satisfy my thirst for connections. So I decided that I need to go international! Here I am. I ask you to surrender yourself to me so I can get to know you. I have a lot of practice in this field, like a good doctor, so it won't hurt, I promise. I don't care about your age, gender, background, ethnicity and whatever else you can think of. To give you a little idea of my odd self I'll present few thingies that kind of set me apart, I guess?

I'm 199/6'6 for my american friends. Not a very common sight. Gym has not been kind to me because of my height either.

I have a total of 6 near death experiences. Some are more interesting than others. All of them mostly my fault. What can I say, I like that thing they call ""adrenaline"".

Sometimes I go on 3 day benders with friends and strangers and sometimes I spend days without human interaction reading a book or something. Moody princess.

I absolutely love to use sarcasm when it absolutely shouldn't be used. Someone just got in a terrible car crash in front of us and their lifeless body is dangling out of the front window? Be sure I'll say something like ""You can't park there, mate"".

I love everything odd, weird and mysterious! Contraversial opinions, dirty secrets and fucked up desires are my bread and butter. If you have any of those please spare so time to tell me. I promise I'll make it worthwhile.

Last but not least, I prefer listening rather than talking. So if you love talking about yourself or about stuff in general without end, you struck gold here.

I still think about my ex nearly a year after the breakup and I need advice.,Fit-Text-8149,1,Advice,0,"Me (16 M) and my ex (17 f now) split up nearly a year ago. We had some amazing times together and I was in love. However, we broke up last year late July because I was caught watching p*rn (please don’t make the same mistake as me). I was a horny teen and I was stupid for that. I wish I never did it. I regret everything I ever done. We fought a lot and did argue a lot over a lot of things. However let’s get to how we met. We met in highschool when I was a few years younger at 13. I dated her for 2 months and then we broke up over something I can’t really remember. A year or two later we dated again for a few days and I left because I wasn’t ready and I was scared. I really broke her heart, she had blocked me for a month and I approached her again after a month. We ended up dating again a few weeks after that late November of 2022. We got closer, so much closer and we fought a few times because of jealousy between us both but even then we were still strong. We went everywhere together, into town and places like museums and all that jazz, she was really into history and she was an amazing artist. Her drawings were so good, I even mistaken it for a non coloured photocopy one time. Everything was going well, we loved each other to bits until one day she had actually gone through my phone and history and found… you know. We argued about it for days then she finally ended things when I was over at hers. I cried really hard. So hard that my eyes were bruised and I could barely see the next morning. It wasn’t her fault however. She was still living even after the breakup for about a week, until she became hard and cold suddenly. Over the next few months she would be hard and cold but then suddenly warm again. We remained good friends for months.I still however cried about her every night and I kept showing up to her house unplanned to spend time with her, I still texted her a lot and always wanted to know how she was doing. I was obsessed badly, so badly that  I annoyed her family and I needed therapy. New years came around and I showed up one last time just to be greeted by hee angry sister who told me to gtfo. I did, I haven’t been back since. We kept in touch however until March of this year. She texted me suddenly one day a big paragraph out of random. She basically said she found somebody new, and to keep things respectful as they weren’t dating yet, she didn’t want to disrespect what she had with this person by being in contact with her ex (me). I completely understood and she blocked me the following day. I asked who it was before it happened and turns out it’s a girl. She is Bi sexual. Anyways sorry for the yapping.

I still can’t get her out of my head. It’s been nearly a year since we broke up and yet I still think and cry about her a lot. I still have photos of us together but although I don’t look at them much I still can’t bring myself to delete them. Therapy didn’t help much either. I try to distract myself with games and music and playing the drums but I still get all my thoughts of her. I avoid her everywhere as she does with me but I still think of her a lot.

Question about CAS CC mods ,MBA32,1,TheSims4Mods,0,"Hi, I’m fairly new to sims & now have just started downloading some cc - starting small with cas mods. 

I downloaded a bunch from miikocc and have gone in game to have a look, and have since removed a couple that I didn’t want or like. 

I’m again looking at some CC, but I’m curious to know more about the files

So for example I’ve downloaded the Rhea skin overlay, but there’s 2 files same name but one mouth crease and one forehead. Are these just the same thing? Just put somewhere different in CAS? or do I need both of these files for it to work? 

Cause the first time downloading stuff I just downloaded everything and it’s a bit of a shambles trying to understand where everything is in-game, and if they’re doubled up? but if I can just remove some files and try to keep everything in the same area then that’s great! 

I’d really like to know to keep my folders more organised, and in-game a bit more organised

**The Setting**

Exiles have been sent from all over civilization to the remote planet for two-hundred years.  
Survivors of earlier exiles have built societies from the wastes, learning to live on what they could find.

With towns and settlements, getting sent to Elimina is no longer the death-sentence it used to be.

**The Vibe**

Sci-fi/Solarpunk with Magic. One member described it as ""Space Australia.""  
We're adults who are here for some writing and fun. We do everything from chill one-off and casual RP to long, world-altering plot progressions.

On Elimina you can join existing settlements, venture out to create your own, live as a space-hermit or become a cult icon. We have big industry executives, backwoods researchers, deranged goblin fairies and more.

**Lore:**

We've built a history for a unique world, enough to provide a structure with room to create your own story. We have rock lore, dirt lore, political lore, science lore and even a little gas lore.

The server has been set up to help you go from joining to making a character with a minimal time investment.

We're an active community with at least a few posts per day, but there is no activity requirement.",05-04-2024
EdgeRouter Lite IP issue ATT Fiber,BuckWilder10,1,Ubiquiti,1,"Recently switched to ATT fiber but for some reason edgerouter lite wont keep the IP that the ATT modem passes to it. Not sure if this is a problem with ATT equipment or the EdgeRouter.

Part time flexibility ,latteandbananabread,1,AusPublicService,0,Hi. New to the APS and been offered a role at DVA which I’m stoked about. In the candidate booklet it said they have flexibility in their agency and part time is one of them. When accepting the role I asked if I could be on a part time contract. I was advised this would be a decision once I start and based on business needs. What are my chances of being able to go part time? I’m worried I’ll start and my request will be denied. I need part time for caring responsibilities. Thanks!,05-04-2024

It completely changes the game dynamic (especially right after what *would* be a wipe for most)  and I can't imagine anyone will buy the version unless they're a die-hard player.  I know the game isn't supposed to be fair, but this is the purest pay-to-win example I have seen considering how much keeping inventory post wipe will change player ability.  For example, at the beginning of wipe any dedicated player will have access to high-level rounds when 80% of the player base is still getting to level 15.  Again, I get that it isn't supposed to be fair, but as soon as this update was released more realism-based competitors have begun showing themselves because this update seems like it will kill Tarkov.",05-04-2024

"Israeli ""genocide"" - it's an antisemitic trope",Pablo-UK,0,Judaism,1,"Those who hate Jews and know nothing about the conflict seem to love calling the Oct 7th war a ""genocide against Palestinians"". What so many have forgotten is that when people began saying this years ago, it started off as an antisemitic trope. It was used to do a conversational debate in bad faith. Recently, it has became so repeated that people now actually believe it could be true, despite it being completely illogical. I've even heard people accuse Israel of hypocrisy because of ""their history"", and yet the irony is they expect Jews to just sit still and be killed. *Because why should the Jews defend themselves?!*

Well reminder, saying that Israel is a genocidal state IS antisemitic. It's tempting to defend Israel and justify why it is not committing genocide but honestly we (I?) need to stop engaging with this argument because it legitimatizes antisemitism. It's Jew hatred and nothing more.

Wide angle and telephoto lens guidance,Ok-Paleontologist32,1,canon,0,"Hi all,
 
Apologies for all the questions recently – I’ve been figuring a lot of this out but the help so far has been great!
 
My current kit is the Canon R7 with the RF18-150mm zoom lens and the RF35mm prime lens. Both seem to be working great, no issues or regrets with either of those choices so far, although have found a couple of limitations from a recent trip out hiking.
 
The first limitation I found was that I didn’t feel like the RF18-150 was wide enough for a few of the landscape shots that I was hoping to take. I wasn’t able to move further back as was limited by a cave of all things, so wasn’t able to get the shot I wanted. I’ve seen that there is an RF-S 10-18mm zoom camera available and it isn’t crazy expensive. It seems like the obvious choice as it will work perfectly with the 18mm of the kit lens and is designed for the r7 cropped image. I did also consider the 16mm prime lens but that isn’t going to be widely different to my 18-150 in terms of the wide angle? Would be interested in your thoughts.
 
The second limitation was that I spotted some wildlife on the other side of the mountain and just couldn’t get close enough to get a close shot. I do see this as a scenario I’ll come across quite often as I live close to the Rockies so come across wildlife quite a bit. Would the RF 100-400mm be the best choice there? The other options would be one of the non L prime lenses 600mm or 800mm but I’m thinking they would be overkill for what I need and that a zoom would probably be more useful.
 
Be great to hear what people think. I think I’m just looking for confirmation I’m on the right path but just in case there are some other options I might not be considering. 

Thanks

Seven Adani group firms say received SEBI show-cause notices,Firm_Resident3315,1,DalalStreetTalks,1,"**Good morning, everyone.**

Let's dive into the latest news from the Adani Group:

Seven firms under the Adani Group have found themselves in the spotlight as they received show cause notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Here are the key details:

1. **Notice Recipients:** Adani Enterprises, the flagship company, revealed receiving two show cause notices from SEBI during the January-March 2023 quarter. Additionally, five other Adani firms—Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar—declared similar notices.
2. **Reason for Notices:** SEBI initiated investigations into alleged violations concerning related party transactions and non-compliance with listing regulations, prompted by allegations from U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
3. **Business Impact:** While the notices raise concerns, the Adani Group firms have assured that they will not significantly impact their business operations.
4. **Political Ramifications:** This development has sparked renewed political tensions between the opposition Congress party and the ruling BJP regarding the perceived relationship between the Adani Group and the government.

**Summary:** The issuance of show cause notices by SEBI to seven Adani Group firms underscores the regulatory scrutiny surrounding their corporate governance practices and related party transactions. While these notices do not represent final judgments, they reflect SEBI's thorough examination in response to allegations raised against the Adani Group.",05-04-2024
Is it appropriate to ask a professor for a reference if I only did good in their class?,Kikikihi,1,college,0,"There’s a scholarship I want to apply for and one section has references so I was thinking about asking a professor who’s class I got an A in (although it wasn’t a super hard class to begin with). 

I’m nervous because besides doing well in his class and asking him questions after class he doesn’t know me and I’m not sure how reluctant professors are to be references or when it’s appropriate. He probably doesn’t even know my name because it’s not like introduce myself every time I ask a question after class (although he would know my face, but no he doesn’t do office hours so I’d have to email). 

I’m in Canada for reference. I’m just really worried it’s not appropriate to ask for something like that given you haven’t done more work under them like research or something.

I have a total of 6 near death experiences. Some are more interesting than others. All of them mostly my fault. What can I say, I like that thing they call ""adrenaline"".

Sometimes I go on 3 day benders with friends and strangers and sometimes I spend days without human interaction reading a book or something. Moody princess.

I absolutely love to use sarcasm when it absolutely shouldn't be used. Someone just got in a terrible car crash in front of us and their lifeless body is dangling out of the front window? Be sure I'll say something like ""You can't park there, mate"".

I love everything odd, weird and mysterious! Contraversial opinions, dirty secrets and fucked up desires are my bread and butter. If you have any of those please spare so time to tell me. I promise I'll make it worthwhile.

Last but not least, I prefer listening rather than talking. So if you love talking about yourself or about stuff in general without end, you struck gold here.


Anyway, now it's your turn to talk! Even if you don't know about what, just shoot me a DM and I'll set everything up.

Dentist only saw my Xray and said chance of a root canal is 50/50,Brisera,1,askdentists,1,"She knows my molar is chipped with decay on the inside though. Looked at my Xray and said chance of a root canal is 50/50, which tells me the decay into the root/nerve isn't substantial, if at all.

"Attempted burglary, how do you protect your home?  ",Early-Ambassador5866,2,AskUK,1,"4.30am this morning just been woken up by jingling of keys in the rear garden bi-fold doors (we sleep in our bedroom downstairs pretty close to them). Got up and looked through the door and i see 2 hooded men one with torch and the other one trying to pick our lock. I have put the garden lights on but they must have though its a sensor light because they continued for a few seconds then i bang loudly on the glass door and they have ran away. We always leave the keys inside the lock and they are turned to the side, did that just wasted them some time and got my wife awake and overall contributed to stop this burglary?

Weird bug is making me sad,xiyu96,1,RimWorld,1,"I was happily playing Rimworld yesterday with no issues whatsoever. Today I load my save and immediately something is wrong. My colony is lagging horrendously and when I open the work tab, every column except the first three is completely blank. So I check the debug log and sure enough, it's freaking the fuck out. [Link to output log](https://gist.github.com/HugsLibRecordKeeper/9729ae1db575edc60b82abf07ee3e1b9).

Naturally I do run some mods. As I said, this modlist worked fine yesterday and RimSort isn't showing any errors, but I know it's likely to be something to do with one of these. Usually I'd just start disabling and reloading until I could pinpoint the culprit but my game already takes so long to load I'd rather leave that as a last resort. Modlist below.

Will WestJet ever get rid of SabreSonic for Amadeus Altea or some other system?,Mindless_Dig_9971,1,westjet,0,"So, 

I have a PNR booked through the Amadeus GDS. 1 Galileo (Apollo) carrier, 1 non WS SabreSonic carrier, 1 Amadeus carrier, and WS, a sabresonic carrier. Both Galileo and Amadeus carriers accept the GDS PNR AND AN OAL PNR as long as it is on the same ticket+is from amadeus or galileo, but WS, and the SabreSonic OAL will not accept the GDS PNR, and they won't even accept another airline's SabreSonic PNR. 

Now, when I finally get the WS PNR, WS's website can't even load the ticket number, just the very basic flight details of the OAL segment (number, origin airport code (city shows as ""Undefined"").) You can add seats but can't change them, unlike with GDS bookings on Galileo and Amadeus, and you can't even view the any SSRs, baggage allowances or anything besides the very very basic flight details and pax names. 

Both Galileo (Non ticket issuing carrier) and Amadeus carrier (Also did not issue the ticket) showed full details regarding the tickets, including all segments, equipment, meals, payment details, SSRs etc. 

WS interlines with many carriers on Amadeus and Galileo. It is about damn time for WS to upgrade to a system that can sucessfully work with other airlines for passengers minds to not be blown with having to have three or four PNRs for a single trip.

I want to talk about what I think is the balance of arrows.,Majestic_Mechanic_33,1,helldivers2,0,"Use Google Translate below
I want to state my conclusion here: Arrow has no idea what type of game it is making.
1.The balance team of Arrow points out that they have participated in the army to suppress the opinions of players, but the performance of combat in the game is not like the battlefield. The combat distance in the game should be within 200 meters, which leads to the fact that shotguns (Arrow believes that shotguns should do better in melee combat. Better knockback and better penetration? ) appears to be too powerful.
2.Among rifles and others, long-range engagement rifles do not perform as well as submachine guns in the game because there is no suitable engagement distance, or because the enemy's firepower is stronger than ours. This is caused by the engagement distance in the game.
3.Arrow tried to refer to other FPS and competitive games to balance a game that is basically a CQB battle. This is a very mistake, causing the game to become too powerful with shotguns, but players all know that shotguns are only enough. , he does not replace everything on higher difficulties, he is just easier to use than other weapons.
4.The balance of arrows simply believes that if a weapon has a high usage rate, it is very powerful, and does not consider whether it is caused by other weapons being too weak (although they seem to have realized this problem in recent updates). The weakening of a weapon is far greater than the strengthening of a weapon, and it should be done step by step.
5.Oh, and I even forgot about the recoilless rifle featured in the Arrow design. For the weapons that used HEAT before, I thought that even though Arrow thought it could only use armor-piercing warheads, why did it give an unreasonable 50% damage reduction? Because the arrow warheads would reduce the jet after penetrating the armor, but what kind of creature's body would eat it? An exploding artillery shell will reduce the jet flow in the circle like a tank? This creature is not even shaken by the explosion of a cannonball! Not to mention, the explosion shock effect of the arrow's flash bomb can be greater than the explosion effect of a larger caliber artillery shell. 
6.I doubt that the balance team actually played the games they made, or even played HellDiver. The previous balance was nostalgic (it may not have been perfect, but it certainly allowed the game to continue to evolve). 
My idea is not completely correct, but I still hope to balance it carefully.",05-04-2024

2. Atmosphere (vibe of the place, people, staff, ambience)
3. Hygiene (don't want bed bugs and diseases) 
4. Safety (want to stay away from scams)

I was checking Booking.com and Hostelworld, but found mixed/fake reviews.. Lot of reviews mentioned how the travellers got scammed (asked to pay twice, refused to be checked in, refunds denied, etc.). Please also let me know if there's any better way of making reservations for the stay.

Any help would be much appreciated. ",05-04-2024

You wanted a letter,Dangerous_Novel2453,1,UnsentLetters,1,"It's really genius what's your up to. Rember I can see to. You want to get me paid without using the embarssibg videos you manufactured so intelligently to destroy me.

So you can use them to bring me back down later. Lol your so fucking evil lol. Hehe

Anyways I think ama start telling everyone I met my story. Idc how embarssing it is .

Am not gay you used hormones and drugs then recorded me cool you got that one.

Now when you try some shit like this and fail and the target finds out and knows som le of the names addresses and I have video c9bfessions from the contractors mouth.

You also tried to kidnapp me and flipped it on me (luckily on recored ) to send me to Mexico but then talked to your PD buddies and got me sent to the get a mental assessment.  Great conver up with the Deming me  unspecified just to see witch way this goes.

Truth is the money is a motivator I mean 7 figures is alot of money . But this was about principal . This was about get back.  But fuck that this was to teach these evil shits they can't play god there is only one God .

Yall having people bow to you is so cliche and fucking condecsinging . You know who you are cigerrte lady lol

Am not going to be able to get the last piece am missing in Latin America

I made peace with my fate. Ama fight.

Ama lose my life in this . But id never sell out incconcent people or people that are to weak to defebd thenselves.

People are generally bad but thats due to the programing these fucks love to ingest. 

Idgaf about idealogies or peoples colors of skin they respect i respect.. 

Am never going to be able to let this go just like that I live humiliated in the hope of finding a beautiful women with no kids sweet and tender wtf I want a gangbanging tatted up fat wife with gang kids for . Not to mention there bad asf.

Yeah am good I know my worth. Ama hold back for awhile something is not right and ill be dam I fuck up a child's future just cuz there parents are pieces of fuxking garbage.

I would sacrifice myself for children and innocent people.  
(Not women we have equality unless your my lady )

Am not for a women paying for everything for me fyi but the soft guy era is hilarious and I love satire not to mention that singal mom song . Harsh but true.

Am not looking forward to moving on. I hate everything and everyone and want God to really save and heal me. Am just harboring so much hate and my thirst for revenge is unhinged.


I will be writing a letter to my cousins and family involved soon as well as rsngo chaplin duff ad Dunn.

As for the prince your being betrayed by your Korean dog guess he wants to be the man now. Don't believe me lol read my mind and find out how lol jkjk that's not possible lol.

No but for real he want to be greedy. He was right about me and I kept denying it to myself about what I wanted in life . I did want the power. But I wanted to be like an independent contractor lol or like freelancers idk if that makes sense. 

I won't co promise my beliefs in God to join anybody. Idc how much I flirted with ideas it was due diligence.


I feel so ducking stale right now and since am isolated I guess writing my thoughts will possibly alienate some pain now that I don't have a niche to bum the pain myself.

Am not depressed or feel destroyed on the contrary.Am angry. 

I need to pray more I need to do better.  Hopefully this feeling of revenge dosent last more years hopefully I can let go .


Feels weird ti be robbed for everything and still feel indifferent and angry at the same time.

And I can't do shit really about it right now.

Hopefully am till on earth when we get the green light .rember I make the best W@$$0$ 😂 


Just a penny for my thoughts you can add it to the money yall fucked me over and destroyed me for.

Funny thing about using your enemies money against them lol. 

They will protect there lifestyles at all cost. Oh boy .

Never thought I'd be in a pit full Rats and snakes.

I’m not right in the head,Proper_Ad8623,1,mentalhealth,0,I don’t feel like myself anymore. I never feel happy anymore. All I feel is anger. I always tell my self negative thoughts even though I try my hardest to be positive. Everyday I just feel angry and I’m so negative and I don’t even hangout with friends anymore. I hate myself too. My whole life I’ve never liked myself. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore because I cringe when I see myself. I hate seeing old pictures of myself so I burnt them all. I don’t know what’s wrong with me I just want to be happy like all the other teenagers. I wish i was normal. I wish the voice in my head wasn’t so fucking negative.,05-04-2024

Help me understand these labs and symptoms?,ShouldProbGoSleep,1,AskDocs,1,"Link to labs screenshots: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yvt1w399NS-xR73O60e\_u40uTZNtfnB0?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yvt1w399NS-xR73O60e_u40uTZNtfnB0?usp=sharing)

As required: 31F, 5'3, white, dizziness and light-headed, \~2 months intermittently, other med issues: heartburn, insomnia, adhd, current meds: adderall xr, trazodone, prevacid, micro-magic-psilocybin, flonase, yes drink, no smoke, no rec drugs (except the magic above).

l've experienced dizziness, nausea, tiredness, some pain with deep breaths and just feeling like breathing is shallow, sometimes tunnel vision, and light-sensitivity. Occasionally w/ dizzy/light-headedness I'll get increased HR, tunnel vision, feeling faint, weakness- at which point I'll lay down for a bit until I feel better. Seems to happen most with stress+ accidentally tensed up muscles and/or high activity level.  
The dr said it was likely my ears even though they looked normal. He did a maneuver to reset my ear crystals, but it didn't really help. Then he tried to just prescribe me dramamine and send me home. Lol  
I asked him to please test my iron levels for the heck of it, but l'm not sure if he did adequate testing. Shouldn't I have gotten a ferritin measurement as well? And others?  
Anyways, iron came back low. Everything else normal. Dr prescribed 200 mg iron daily with vitamin C, and retest in 3 months.  


Labs (as screenshots) are linked in folder above, files labeled 1 through 9. 

  
Can someone tell me if these tests are adequate though? I am skeptical... other people have more tests? Dr didn't suspect iron deficiency (I think he was so set on it being my ear crystals... really only did blood because I insisted) so I wouldn't be surprised if this is not enough. But I don't understand any of the abbreviations (looks like they also ran immune panel and other basics), so maybe there is more iron-related stuff I'm just not seeing?

Do iron levels vary from day to day? How quickly should these supplements help?

  
I have taken the supplement 2 days now and honestly I feel even more nauseous. I don't want to go on taking this for 3 months and possibly for the rest of my life without being sure I need it and without ruling out other indirect causes.  
Aside from prescribing the iron, dr didn't tell me anything else like if my symptoms could be attributed to the low iron/ which ones/what to watch out for etc. Is the level mildly or moderately or seriously low? Could that be causing all of the above symptoms?  
I should also note, my periods are and have always been super heavy. Also, my diet isn't great (it's also not the worst) but is relatively healthy compared to how it was years ago. I do eat a lot of cereal, meat, etc., but not a ton of veggies besides salad

Also, I have had vertigo with ear infections and allergies in the past, and even though my ears are not currently infected and I'm not sick, they always pop often and feel full

Also, I have an appointment with an eye-specialist next week to see if it's something called binocular vision dysfunction (I tend to close one eye while reading, and the vertigo seems worse with certain vision stuff). I may cancel that if this is all easily explained by the low iron, though?

  
TIA for any insight :)",05-04-2024

Could it be possible to have the OT line back but with a different meaning? ,gjp11,1,NASCAR,0,"So to preface, I hate seeing races end in cautions. Especially cautions not caused by the leaders. Most of the time I feel like we can just let the survivors race to the line. Now In some cases it makes sense. Daytona 500 this year the wreck was right on the line. Allow the rest of the field to race it out and you could have a horrible disaster. 

But when the crash is on say the backstretch can we not let survivors race it out to the finish? Surely it’s a safe distance away from the start/finish line.

I guess the question becomes where do you draw that line of what’s safe distance away from the finish.

So My idea here is to bring back the overtime line but change what it means. At each track NASCAR can decide on a place on the track where they deem the winner, crossing the finish line finish at full speed, would have enough time to slow down to pace speed after getting the checkered flag. For Daytona I could see that being really on the exit of 2. For something like martinsville it would prob be in the middle of the backstretch approaching turn 3. Idk someone smarter than I can figure it out. 

So if the field gets past that line on the final lap then don’t throw the caution until the winner crosses. 

If the field didn’t get to that line then re-rack them for another shot at it. 

Someone else must have thought of this before. Which makes me think I’m missing something that would make this idea not work. But I wanted to discuss with y’all since I’m a newbie to the sport.

19M I'll probably like you.,Kwikis1,1,friendship,1,"I like people. I like good people, bad people, good-bad people and bad-good people. With all their flaws and imperfections.

So I decided that I need to go international! Here I am. I ask you to surrender yourself to me so I can get to know you. I have a lot of practice in this field, like a good doctor, so it won't hurt, I promise. I don't care about your age, gender, background, ethnicity and whatever else you can think of. To give you a little idea of my odd self I'll present few thingies that kind of set me apart, I guess?

I'm 199/6'6 for my american friends. Not a very common sight. Gym has not been kind to me because of my height either.

I have a total of 6 near death experiences. Some are more interesting than others. All of them mostly my fault. What can I say, I like that thing they call ""adrenaline"".

Sometimes I go on 3 day benders with friends and strangers and sometimes I spend days without human interaction reading a book or something. Moody princess.

I absolutely love to use sarcasm when it absolutely shouldn't be used. Someone just got in a terrible car crash in front of us and their lifeless body is dangling out of the front window? Be sure I'll say something like ""You can't park there, mate"".

I love everything odd, weird and mysterious! Contraversial opinions, dirty secrets and fucked up desires are my bread and butter. If you have any of those please spare so time to tell me. I promise I'll make it worthwhile.

Last but not least, I prefer listening rather than talking. So if you love talking about yourself or about stuff in general without end, you struck gold here.

### Expanding Your Reach with Google Plus Sharing

Integrating Google Plus sharing into your email newsletter strategy might seem like a step back at first glance, especially in an era dominated by other social platforms. However, this integration offers a unique advantage by targeting a specific audience segment that appreciates the professional and niche communities found on Google Plus. The platform, known for its engagement with tech-savvy users, professionals, and hobbyist groups, can help your content resonate with an audience that values detailed, informative content. This approach not only broadens your content's reach but also aligns with a demographic that is likely to engage deeply with your material. By incorporating a Google Plus share link, you're not just casting a wider net but also fishing in waters known for their quality catch.

Moreover, the process of adding a Google Plus share link to your email newsletters is straightforward, requiring minimal technical know-how. This simplicity ensures that your marketing team can implement this feature without needing extensive training or resources. The real benefit lies in the seamless integration of social sharing within your email content, making it as easy as a single click for your readers to share your newsletter. This not only enhances the visibility of your content but also leverages the inherent trust within social networks. When subscribers share your content within their circles, it comes with an implicit endorsement, which can significantly boost your credibility and attract new subscribers. Thus, the strategic inclusion of a Google Plus link is not just about expanding reach; it's about enhancing the quality and impact of your audience engagement.

### Maximizing Engagement Through Google Plus Integration

When considering the inclusion of a Google Plus share link in email newsletters, it's essential to understand the platform's unique positioning in the social media landscape. Although Google Plus might not have the same mainstream appeal as other social networks, it fosters niche communities and professional groups that can be highly valuable to marketers. These communities often engage more deeply with content, making them an ideal audience for specialized or industry-specific newsletters. By enabling easy sharing to Google Plus directly from an email, marketers can tap into these engaged communities, extending their content's reach and increasing its potential impact.

Furthermore, integrating a Google Plus share link also supports SEO efforts. Google's algorithms have historically favored content shared on their platforms, and while the direct impact of social shares on rankings is debated, the increased visibility and traffic to your website can have a positive effect. This strategy also complements other digital marketing efforts by creating a more cohesive online presence, allowing your audience to engage with your content across multiple platforms. The added visibility on Google Plus can lead to increased brand recognition, more substantial community engagement, and ultimately, higher conversion rates as your content reaches a broader yet targeted audience.

"⚠️ 6 months seperation, feeling sad but is it me mirroring or am i just sad abou the sitch?",unknownuser63727,1,twinflames,0,"Roughly in fall of 2023 I met a guy. I really started to like him and started learning more about the LOA hoping i could manifest it.

He would always tell me how he wanted to do certin things together. He ghosted me, then i found out he had gotten a gf almost over night. (She looks like me in 2021, which is weird)

At the end of october and early novemever he ended up blocking me on almost everything and wouldnt explain what was up.

We havent spoken since but i eventually got over it. Ive been working on my self concept and honestly am doing great.

There wasnt anything happening between us within this 6 months but about a month ago i started having dreams about him again. It feels like we were meeting in the 5D?

Also everytime i think about him i suddenly get super depressed like im going to cry?

I dont know if im feeling his emotions about the situation or if maybe im just sad again about the situation?

Our connection feels so much deeper than surface, iykyk.

He also doesn’t lean in to talk to anybody male or female but with me he leans on the counter and gets close enough to where I can pick up his scent unless I am with somebody then he doesn’t lean on the counter he just stands across from me.
I’ve been told he isn’t a phone person, and I’ve sent him a few texts but he left me on read, although there was a time where I needed some glass cleaner to do a task at work and I sent him a text asking if his work had any I could borrow and he answered right away and let me borrow it to do this task. A few texts were sent back and forth and even though I waited like 5 minutes before sending a text back he answered immediately. 
Whenever I say something funny he laughs but he looks away from me when he laughs. What does this mean?
He’s very shy and introverted so I start most of the conversations, but he seems to be interested.
We met through my cousin who had worked with him for 4 years and they’ve been friends about 3 years. I added him on snap and he added me back a couple hours later because he was at work at the time but he’s been friends with my cousin and her husband for 3 years and still hasn’t added them.

I don't like how the article is stereotyping all Christians as white nationalists and racists just because of certain political leaders. I am tired of how people in my school are able to openly and actively speak against Christianity without being worried or getting canceled. Meanwhile I wouldn't be able to criticize other religions and if I did I would get in trouble and be canceled.

Their attitudes and their ideals. I know a lot of people. Coworkers, friends, classmates, acquaintances. But it's not enough to satisfy my thirst for connections. So I decided that I need to go international! Here I am. I ask you to surrender yourself to me so I can get to know you. I have a lot of practice in this field, like a good doctor, so it won't hurt, I promise. I don't care about your age, gender, background, ethnicity and whatever else you can think of. To give you a little idea of my odd self I'll present few thingies that kind of set me apart, I guess?

I'm 199/6'6 for my american friends. Not a very common sight. Gym has not been kind to me because of my height either.

I have a total of 6 near death experiences. Some are more interesting than others. All of them mostly my fault. What can I say, I like that thing they call ""adrenaline"".

Sometimes I go on 3 day benders with friends and strangers and sometimes I spend days without human interaction reading a book or something. Moody princess.

I absolutely love to use sarcasm when it absolutely shouldn't be used. Someone just got in a terrible car crash in front of us and their lifeless body is dangling out of the front window? Be sure I'll say something like ""You can't park there, mate"".

I love everything odd, weird and mysterious! Contraversial opinions, dirty secrets and fucked up desires are my bread and butter. If you have any of those please spare so time to tell me. I promise I'll make it worthwhile.

Last but not least, I prefer listening rather than talking. So if you love talking about yourself or about stuff in general without end, you struck gold here.

Seven Adani group firms say received SEBI show-cause notices,Firm_Resident3315,1,IndianStockResearch,0,"**Good morning, everyone.**

Let's dive into the latest news from the Adani Group:

Seven firms under the Adani Group have found themselves in the spotlight as they received show cause notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Here are the key details:

1. **Notice Recipients:** Adani Enterprises, the flagship company, revealed receiving two show cause notices from SEBI during the January-March 2023 quarter. Additionally, five other Adani firms—Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar—declared similar notices.
2. **Reason for Notices:** SEBI initiated investigations into alleged violations concerning related party transactions and non-compliance with listing regulations, prompted by allegations from U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
3. **Business Impact:** While the notices raise concerns, the Adani Group firms have assured that they will not significantly impact their business operations.
4. **Political Ramifications:** This development has sparked renewed political tensions between the opposition Congress party and the ruling BJP regarding the perceived relationship between the Adani Group and the government.

**Summary:** The issuance of show cause notices by SEBI to seven Adani Group firms underscores the regulatory scrutiny surrounding their corporate governance practices and related party transactions. While these notices do not represent final judgments, they reflect SEBI's thorough examination in response to allegations raised against the Adani Group.",05-04-2024

"Wait, was the Dead Pixel incident actually manufactured for a merch drop?",Lanceo90,1,LinusTechTips,0,"First off, if they wanted to make a dead pixel line of stuff apropo of nothing at all, I'm fine with that.  They can make what they want.  Maybe the idea is like, they want to release an all black line of merch, and this is a funny way to spin it.  Sure, I'm down with that.  


However, if they really put just a single white pixel image on an OBS layer last week, and then Dan and Luke pretended like it was real, hyped it up, told chat to calm down about it; and then the marketing team whipped it up on social media to memeify it...  


It really doesn't sit well with me.  It's really disingenuous.  Going on now, I won't be able to believe anything funny that happens on the show is a natural reaction, or if they're just manufacturing a meme for a product.  


I'd even be okay with it if it was an April Fool's joke and drop, that's fine.  Bit late for that now though.  


To get out ahead of the defenders.  No, it's not like they killed an animal live on the show or something.  I'm not angry, I'm disappointed.  And yes, I don't have to buy it; but you don't have to buy something to voice concerns about it.",05-04-2024

Trimmed my plants down to their base to get rid of BBA. Please Help.,Elegant_Spend8259,1,PlantedTank,0,"Should I cut back my lights, ferts, and co2? I got to the point where i was so sick of trimming my plants to get rid of BBA just to look into the tank and see a spot that I missed. 

I hope I didn’t trim too much to the point where they won’t grow back but the stems were pretty much level with the substrate. About 80% of them. The rest I just took an inch or two off. Most of them are medium/high light plants that I’ve been growing without co2 for the past 4 months. The rest are low light. I know that a lack of co2 can lead to an imbalance and as a result I got struck with an outbreak maybe 1 month ago. I’ve been trimming frequently to limit it but whenever I’d be done I saw a spot that I missed. It started on my Erio. Vietnam then slowly spread to my:
hygrophilia
crypts
pearl weed
microsword
rotalas
repens
dwarf sag
ludwigia and 
Mermaid plant

Am I doing something wrong to get the black beard algae or was it my lack of co2, and when I see the new growth the problem will be solved?

OG DS not turning on or charging after screen and shell replacement,realpkmnmaster,1,consolerepair,0,"Posted this in ifixit.com and got no replies so I’ll try here! My bottom screen needed a replacement because there was a black line across it. I also wanted to change the shell while I am at it. Before I worked with my DS, I made sure everything was still working. This included charging, all buttons, game reading. Everything worked fine and so I started and carefully put everything together in the new shell. I tried to power it on but it doesn’t power on anymore. It doesn’t even charge either. I tried reinserting all the ribbon cables multiple times and tried new batteries but that doesn’t work. It has turned to paperweight. How do I figure out what happened? I have a multimeter but I don’t really know how to use it. I think I may have blown a fuse after researching a bit but I don’t know how since I used padding on the bottom screen to separate it with the motherboard. I think I did hear a little popping noise the first time I tried to power it on. 

I tried using the multimeter, here’s what I did but not sure if I’m doing it right: On the F2, I touched the right side of the F2 and the left side of the battery and my multimeter beeps. Every other combination with F2 and the battery doesn't work. Does that mean the fuse is blown?

when you're out  chatting and you realize the person you're talking to probably isn't going to like this............,littletwinstarspeace,1,tea,0,"hi all.

  
i was out a coffee shop, because where i live the tea places aren't on every corner and cool coffee shops are more conveniently found(even though i abhor coffee) and they close earlier than the coffee shops and i'm a night owl,  doing some work and enjoying the shared space and people there as one does.

  
a couple older than me sits next to me and strikes up a conversation. i see what they ordered being delivered to them, it's a teapot full of purple blue liquid. i immediately think i know what it is but instead of assuming i go ahead and say that looks so cool what did you order?

  
it infact was the butterfly pea flower tea, they then said they never had it before and just decided on a whim to order it.

  
it reminds me of the three different times and the three different stores i  tried it, and each time it was the most blandest experience in my entire life. no offense to those that love it, i just know that it's for those that don't love it an acquired thing.

  
i decided to share my experience and say yeah you might not like it, i have had it a few different places and find it to be pretty bland, you're probably not going to taste much when you drink it. the wife said that's why she ordered some honey with it and i said that's probably a good move.

  
i see them then go to drink it and they agreed that it really didn't taste like much.

  
there are thousands of blends out there and hundreds of variations of teas..i'm no expert but i've had more than the regular fellow american and so sometimes when i'm out and about i can gauge my experience and sometimes have like this a premonition of what's about to happen. haha.

A kind of joke character CT,Spirited_County_6579,1,CTsandbox,0,"The cursed technique, Pecking Order, asks one question and one question only.

“How many chickens can you take on in a fight?”

The CT automatically answers this question by turning the user into a medium for a limitless amount of chicken shikigami, taking the maximum number of chickens the target can fight and adding one to the total. In a long, drawn-out battle, this means that there will always be a balance of one shikigami. The user can also create any amount of chickens needed to block an attack as a defensive option with the same logic as its primary application.

The shikigami themselves are simply regular chickens created out of the user’s CE and have no special properties. When destroyed, they disappear into thin air.

Domain Expansion: Slaughterhouse Six

The sure-hit effect of the domain is to activate the effects of Pecking Order using the enemies body as a medium. This can disrupt their movement, distract them, and if activated long enough, cause suffocation.

Pros:

- EXTREMELY CE efficient
- Each chicken can be controlled individually without much concentration
- High utility (distraction, crowd control, literally changing the environment of battle)

Cons:

- The user himself can be easy to defeat if you ignore the chickens and go straight for him
- Other than pecking and squashing you, the chickens have no other offensive options themselves

How do you drop the last pump? ,hmokaythen,1,ExclusivelyPumping,1,"I’m so close to being done with my journey ! Been pumping and supplementing with formula for 8 months. I dropped my final pump and the next day, I noticed that I had a small lump/clog, but it did not seem to be getting worse so I just left it alone. Well, a couple days after that it did get worse and it was painful. At this point it had been one week since I last pumped so I decided to pump to get the clog out. The clog was in my left boob, so I only pumped that boob. Of course, when I was done, I decided to feel my right boob, and I realized there was a lump in there too. So I pumped that boob for a bit too. But, that was yesterday morning, and I realized I still have a lump/clog in my right boob.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I know that results may vary from person to person. Should I wait to see if this clog gets worse? Or should I just pump to get it out? 

Also, toward the end of my pumping journey, when I was down to just one pump a day, both of my nipples started getting chapped and started  bleeding a bit . Thought this was strange since this had not happened at all on my journey. It was so nice to have a week off from pumping, And I thought I was truly done pumping! But even pumping again yesterday re-irritated my nipples.

God spoke to me so clearly a little bit ago…. ,Princesspartya,1,Christianity,0,"So I see a lot of followers of Christ on TikTok, and almost every one of them speaks on hearing Gods voice clearly and often. While I have experienced this myself a few times, I always struggle with knowing whether it is my own voice or God’s. So last night I prayed for God to help me to be able to hear his voice loud and clear when he is speaking to me. 

Well earlier I was picking out my pajamas, and I grabbed a shirt from my closet, and it felt weirdly heavy. So much so that I thought another piece of clothing was attached to it somehow or something. So I quietly asked “why is this shirt so heavy….” And God CLEAR as day said “because you feel lighter.”

Side note: for about 3-4 days now I have been seriously strengthening my relationship with him. And I have felt peace and happiness like I never have before. I feel whole. I feel complete. I feel like the embodiment of love. 

God is so good and he does listen to us. 🩷

Married men help?,EntrepreneurOne8614,1,AskMenAdvice,1,"To give you guys some context, I recently gave birth to my two twin boys back in February of this year and my husband has been critiquing of sex life. He tells me to constantly switch from missionary (which is my fav position) to back shots (doggy style), to which we do all the time and we are constantly trying different positions. But this time it was different and when I commented on why he suddenly is only requesting back shots all the time, he totally got pissed and flipped it back on me. He told me that I was over reacting and that I was insecure! To give you some context, ever since I had our babies he has been distant, only coming to visit during holidays or when I ask (we have a long distance marriage & he lives in America vs me in the states) and this started once I gave birth to our sons. Since the birth he has changed his look, getting his hair braided ( which he never has done, he usually puts his hair in a bun and calls it a day) our sex life before was amazing and now he acts like he is too cool to be with me or our kids. He loved eye contact, taking me to the shower/ jacuzzi and now it seems like he only visits out of obligation or his family pressuring him. (when he goes back to Canada he lives with his mom, which is 7 months out of the year) I’ll be honest, I haven’t been taking care of myself due to postpartum, but I’m not dirty or ugly and when we have sex he barely is into it, acts as if it’s a duty due to his mannerisms ( I gained weight but I’m still slim, my body is normal other than my putruding belly after birth) i do not know what to do. I understand he has a life and friends in America before and after me, I am not opposed to relationships of any kind as long as you respect me and let me know what’s going on in your life. He carry’s himself as if he wants to keep his life in America vs me separate. For me I do not agree with this, I’ve had numerous conversations about how I feel and what I want with him and he refuses to take any accountability. He blames me every time I bring up the topic.

Then, the first comment I got wasn't even about the story but about an error in the definition of an ancient word. 

Frankly it upsets me, I'm sorry but I don't understand why all these ghost readers, and then I had two people who came privately and on my profile to ask me when I would publish the rest; honestly I have no desire to publish if people don't show me enthusiasm for a story that has been published since September.

The thing is, if I had 0 readers on my other stories, I could be like well maybe my stories don't interest anyone, but I have a lot of comments, people reacting etc, saying my writing is good and everything, but in the fanfiction, I have none. And then they came by DM and on my wall to ask for the rest of the story... I may seem selfish but it doesn't motivate me if I don't see a minimum of interest from the reader and a reaction.

You're still pining for that ideal relationship. Here's why. 🦋,leaningagainsthemast,1,NevilleGoddard,0,"***NOTE: No TL:DR. Read it whole. I promise it'll help.]***

I'm not an expert at relationships. In fact, my past would STRONGLY argue otherwise 😂 BUUUT I can honestly say that I've had quite a bit of practice **deliberately manifesting** relationships. 

That's my area, you guyss! 😂 and I feel that what I have to share might be the missing piece that FINALLY gets you what you want so desperately! ✨️

🦋 Now, a lil background check: I've manifested going on casual dates to getting the guy I was obsessed with at the time. And all of it I did with SATS. 

Now first of all, SATS is not a technique to fear but to fall in love with! Applying a technique doesn't make the whole process less magical or make you less of a GOD! 🪄

🦋 And the presence of a little resistance in your path doesn't mean that you're on the wrong road. It doesn't mean you need to frantically look for alternative ways or techniques that make the process feel...easier, so to speak. 

So bear that in mind the next time you encounter some difficulties during youe initial days of adopting SATS as your primary technqiue for subconscious impression of your assumptions. 🌸

⛄️ **NOW ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS!!** 

The reason that resuults elude soo soo many of you when it comes to deliberately manifesting a fulfilling relationship is **because your focus is on alll the wrong things!** 

✨️ You put your hopes in the SP instead of the FEELING they should inspire in you. 

What I mean is, 

***Your focus is never on the IDEAL but the person.*** 

🪄 What do I mean by that? 

Well, when I look back on some of my failed attempts (yes, I've had those too!) at manifesting a relationship, there was a pattern that I noticed every single time. 

It was that in all the scenarios where I failed at successfully manifesting the guy, my scenes revolved around the person in question, rather than the **FEELINGS OF SATISFACTION** that being with the said person should inspire in ME. 

🌸 The focus needs to be ON YOU. on YOUR feelings. Not the other person. 

It's a bit difficult to grasp, I get it. But bear with me.

⛄️ **For example:**

✨️Instead of creating a scene that *your SP* texted you saying that *they* love you very much, **create a scene where you are lying in a bed or hugging each other and FEEL how HAPPY **YOU** are now that **YOU** are with the person **YOU** have always desired! 

Feel the shift here? 

Now everything is about YOU and the feelings YOU feel now that you're with the person YOU love so much! 

🪄 **FEEL** the gratitude as you hug your SP. **FEEL** the satisfaction of being in a *LOVING, HEALTHY, FULFILLING* relationship.

⛄️ As you can see, the difference in these two scenarios is that -

1. In the first scenario, your attention during the scene is completely absorbed by what your SP is doing, i.e. sending you a text, saying I'm sorry and all that. 

2. In the second scene, however, your whole focus during the imaginal drama is on the FEELINGS that you would ultimately feel when you are with your SP, in a **healthy, fulfilled relationship.** 

⛄️ You might say that what's so new here? The *feeling* part is a necessary step in all kinds of manifestations, not just while manifesting an SP. 

I agree but ***when it comes to relationships, it's VERY VERY easy to manifest something that looked good on paper but was shit in reality!***

✨️ I know because it's happened to me before. 

And this happens only when the focus is on the SP in question instead of focusing on the QUALITY of the relationship youw ant to manifest with the said SP. 

🌸 **I've found, through experience, that the ideal scene for almost every romantic SP manifestation is** - 

🪄 Imagine that you are hugging your SP, preferrably while laying together in your bed. Assume that you are going to sleep together. Imagine you are hugging them. 

Assume, once again and firmly, who you are with (i.e. your SP's name) and then, as you feel their body solidly real next to you, begin FEELING a sense of SATISFACTION AND FULFILLMENT! 

It comes easier when you repeat to yourself, *""I am so ecstatic and happy that we are together.""* (or any version of this statement). Keep repeating it as you feel their body solidly real.

✨️ This scene very easily captures all the elements and feelings required to create a sense of reality for your subconscios self as you fall asleep. 

I hope this helps all of you who are trying to deliberatly manifest an SP. All the best, you guys! 

Until next time,

AITA Bachelorette party is way too expensive ,Substantial_Ad4423,1,aitaweddings,0,"To make a long story short, my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid and I said yes. The wedding will be in Florida near the end of March (spring break time) and the MOH has not reached out to anyone about budgets for a Bachelorette party. I just got a text and the trip will be in Nashville and the air bnb is like $700 a person and will be a month before the wedding, but they'reasking for half the amount for making a downpayment this weekend. Round trip tickets will more than likely be ~$300, so just traveling and room will be pushing $1000 for just this weekend trip. After eating, drinking and ubering for a long weekend it's probably going to push $1500 in total.

Then the wedding is a month later and round trip tickets for spring break travel near Miami will easily be $400-600 a person. The dresses the MOH is asking us to look at start off at $200, then we're also being expected to use a stylist that they like who charges like another $200 something per person.

AITA for thinking this is way too much to ask of a bridesmaid?? Like technically yes I could afford it if we had months to save before making an initial payment, but no budgets were discussed before this bomb was dropped today and I'm honestly kind of mad that I'm being asked to drop $400 in the next day or 2.

I’ve never done anything so gut wrenchingly bad. My oldest sister has gotten piercings, tattoos, has drank and always disobeys my parents, lying to them about practically everything. My second oldest sister has gotten caught taking edibles, and is always fighting with my parents as well. I’m not saying I’m an angel or that I’m perfect but I’ve never done anything so terrible to my parents. Although they have failed classes and have gotten caught drinking on multiple occasions, I’ve never gotten anything below a 3.8 GPA, with my average GPA being 4.2, and I have never gotten drunk before. I’m also involved in many clubs and I would consider myself a great student, as my teachers have written letters to my house before. Even though I’ve has no interest in being “bad” my parents are really strict  with me. Even though all my friends are good freaks like me, I was not really allowed to go out often. However, this is my senior year and I value memories a lot. So finally this year my parents let me go to homecoming and football games. Senior ditch day was coming up and all my friends had plan to go to the beach. I thought maybe since I’ve worked so hard in school and a basically have two weeks left that I deserve to have fun with my friends once last time. When I brought this idea to my parents, they first opposed but then decided to let me ditch. I was super happy until they said I just had to stay hom because they were going out. So my senior ditch day consisted of taking care of my extremely hyper two year old cousin that never listens and washing dishes. I began to cry as I saw my friends and practically everyone I knew post about going to the beach. When my parents got home, I went to my room cause I didn’t want to be upset in front of them. They know I’m sad and upset because I overheard them talking about it. should I stay upset? This was the last time I could do something cool and fun and I just feel so sad because I worked so hard and yet I still can’t be a teenager.

This isn't to say that I wish them harm at all, simply a pang in the heart that I desire what they have. Recently it hit me that envy happens to be one of the seven deadly sins as well. I used to listen to subliminals to change my facial features, but I've stopped that since coming back to God (cradle Cath, went away for a while, came back)- though the longing still lingers most of the time. What would be a mature way to handle such feelings? For the record, I've heard it all from ""none of that matters"", ""you're pretty"", ""God created you in His image"" and ""we should be grateful (for our current looks)"". Yes I do acknowledge that none of that matters in front of God, but in our human lives, especially as a woman, your attractiveness plays a big part in how you're treated in the world and I'm not naive enough to say that it's not impactful. I am grateful for my current looks, I just sometimes wish I was born with better features. I'm not looking to be prettier to find a man- I understand the point of attracting the right kind of man. I'm looking to be prettier to feel better and satisfied within my own skin. Knowing that you're beautiful. How do you handle such feelings in a better, practical way?",05-04-2024

About the dissing competition ,kuroharuko,1,soundcloud,0,"Eyo, not an artist, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. That being said. 

I understand that it's sad that it costs money, but if u wanna be an upcoming underground artist in any genre, u all know soundcloud is the only spot. I have artists that I follow that have less followers than me with just with the reposts. It is a great spot to find actual heads who listen to your type of music. 

Dunno on average how many of u were there when they said they'll close down in 2016 or 17 but it really shows. Anyone who had to live through that unsure months of heartbreak I think we're all happily paying for whatever the product now includes. 

I'd appreciate some praise as well for keeping up the underground global scene by not affecting their algorithm with profit incentives to push the popular shit, only in suggestions.

Best Experience with a  Governance Process?,lost_redditor_75,1,ExperiencedDevs,0,"I’ve found myself leading/creating a team that owns the department’s development processes, and one of my biggest pain points is the overall governance process.  

I’ve tried to adapt the pre-existing processes to our needs, but the internal customers we have are very difficult to say the least.  
  
Currently, we have a user story system in Jira, where we receive both development requirements and support tickets. When we receive a ticket, we validate its feasibility, assign some estimates for both complexity and time, then assign some system-driven due dates. Not once our customers have been ok with those, as _everything is urgent_. We then have to gather all the teams until they reach an agreement and basically assign priorities among themselves, only to jump ship when they have to test something, delaying every previously reached agreement.  

Other recurrent topic is receiving _critical_ stories when we’re already in sprint mode; and being thrown at the hierarchies for them to push us to include it on our goal.  
  
Then, how can I revert this situation? We’ve had constant communication with these teams, and they say they’re willing to collaborate and align with our processes, but as soon as a fire starts on their end they go back to default mode.  

How can I attach these issues directly from our governance system? Is it even possible? Is this team doomed? Am I doomed?

My boyfriend still lives with his ex girlfriend.,ElegantPlantain4931,1,dating,1,"We’ve now been dating for 4 months. He lives 45 minutes away so we see each other over the weekend. Three months ago I found out he’s still living with his ex. We were on video chat and I suddenly heard a woman’s voice, and he quickly hung up on me. We talked for hours after that. 

Apparently he is stuck in this situation because of finances. 

I believed him, for a while. Now I am skeptical. 

There are a few red flags: 

1) My biggest one is that I am a secret from his ex. When she’s home we can’t video chat, only text. I’ve asked plenty of times why she doesn’t know about me, and he says it’s because he doesn’t want confrontation. 

2) he’s bailed on me at the last minute, like three of four times. Without a really good excuse (I’m tired, etc) 

3) he has met my family but I have not met his. I was actually supposed to see his family this Sunday, but when I asked tonight to confirm plans he said that his brother (the family i was going to visit) is tired and doesn’t feel like it, so he’s going to come down to see me. 

4) Disappeared on me once when I was expecting him and his explanation was that he got annoyed with me blowing up his phone so he just turned it on silent and left me wondering where the hell he is when he was supposed to come visit me, those were the plans. I only started blowing up his phone when he wasn’t answering a few hours after he was supposed to be here. So….? I don’t know. 

5) He said last week that he’s going to move in with his brother later this May, when his ex gf is going on vacation. But the only reason he said that is because last week I got pretty upset at him about the whole situation and the fact that he’s not doing shit about it for so long now. But… he hasn’t made any further plans or even mentioned moving in with his brother after that one conversation. He is renting a home with his ex girlfriend and I’m not sure how it all works but I don’t know if he can just abandon his house just like that? Just sneak out of his house and not come back? He doesn’t seem to have a plan. 

Besides this he treats me amazingly and I love him so much! He talks as if he is very serious about me and our future. I feel the same way. 

I need advice from people on the outside, I need as much opinions and advice as I can get. What should I do? Should I be concerned? What is your opinion on this whole thing? 

Thank you.

Benefits of Incorporating Indian Gooseberry (Amla) Into Your Summer Diet,LetBeFriendsHere,1,HealthCheck,0,"   

[Beneftis Of Eating AMLA During Summer](https://preview.redd.it/9mzmw6g29cyc1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=00457bd3f77d1624ecae9d8e87c406dd631fd010)

As the scorching summer heat sets in, it's crucial to prioritize foods that not only keep you hydrated but also nourish your body with essential nutrients. One such superfood that shines during the summer months is Indian Gooseberry, commonly known as Amla. Bursting with flavor and loaded with health benefits, Amla is a must-add to your summer diet. In this article, we delve into the numerous advantages of incorporating Amla into your meals during the summer season.

# Boosts Immunity

Amla is renowned for its high vitamin C content, making it a potent immunity booster. During the summer months, when the risk of infections is higher due to the heat, consuming Amla can help fortify your immune system and ward off illnesses.

# Hydrates the Body

Staying hydrated is vital during the hot summer days, and Amla can contribute to your fluid intake. Whether consumed in the form of fresh fruit or as a refreshing juice, Amla helps keep your body hydrated, preventing dehydration and ensuring optimal bodily functions.

# Promotes Digestive Health

Digestive issues often exacerbate during the summer months, but Amla can offer relief. Its high fiber content aids in digestion, prevents constipation, and promotes gut health, ensuring smooth digestion even in the sweltering heat.

# Cooling Properties

Amla possesses natural cooling properties that help regulate body temperature and provide relief from the heat. Adding Amla to your diet can help cool down the body internally, making it an excellent choice for combating the summer heat.

# Rich in Antioxidants

Antioxidants are essential for protecting the body against oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Amla is packed with antioxidants like vitamin C and flavonoids, which neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation, and prevent cellular damage, keeping your skin and body healthy during summer.

Supports Weight Management

For those aiming to shed a few pounds during the summer, Amla can be a valuable ally. Its low-calorie content, combined with its ability to boost metabolism and aid digestion, makes it a weight-loss-friendly fruit that can help you achieve your fitness goals.

# Improves Skin and Hair Health

Summer can take a toll on your skin and hair, but Amla comes to the rescue. Its abundance of vitamin C promotes collagen production, maintaining skin elasticity and preventing premature aging. Additionally, Amla nourishes the scalp, strengthens hair follicles, and promotes luscious locks.

# How to Incorporate Amla Into Your Diet

Now that you're aware of the myriad benefits of Amla, you might be wondering how to include it in your summer diet. Here are some simple and delicious ways to incorporate Amla into your meals:

1. **Fresh Amla Juice**: Start your day on a refreshing note by drinking a glass of freshly squeezed Amla juice.

2. **Amla Salad**: Add chopped Amla to your salads for a tangy twist and an extra dose of nutrients.

3. **Amla Chutney**: Prepare a zesty Amla chutney to accompany your meals and enhance their flavor.

4. **Amla Candy**: Indulge your sweet tooth with homemade Amla candy, a healthier alternative to sugary snacks.

5. **Amla Smoothie**: Blend Amla with other fruits and yogurt to create a delicious and nutritious smoothie perfect for hot summer days.

# Conclusion

Incorporating Indian Gooseberry, or Amla, into your summer diet offers a plethora of health benefits, ranging from boosting immunity to promoting skin and hair health. With its cooling properties, antioxidant-rich composition, and versatility in culinary applications, Amla is a true summer superfood that deserves a place on your plate. So, make the most of this seasonal gem and reap its abundant rewards for a healthier and happier summer season.",05-04-2024

It happened ,vintageideals,1,bigboobproblems,1,"I took my kids to a function at our new church. I wore a pink blouse that’s got a slight swoop neck, but it’s definitely not low cut. I asked my oldest daughter if, with the sheer size of my chest, it was still “noticeable” cleavage. She said no. I wore a thin over shirt anyhow, to sort of make the pink blouse seem even less revealing. 

I did fine and nobody looked at me odd or anything.

Until we were leaving. I’m chasing after my youngest and I hear someone keep calling my name. It’s this sweet old lady I’ve been talking to in emails and on the phone with, but hadn’t met yet. She literally spent half the time we talked staring at and talking to chest. LOL.Whyyyyyyy. I really think it’s true that as people age, they lose a little bit of their control over their visuals. It’s like they develop an actual string problem.

How to take care of my new 4090. What can i do to prevent melting cables. ,TemperatureGreedy396,1,pcmasterrace,0,"Ok. So i have done a ton of research from youtube, google, reddit questions similar to mine and gotten alot of information at the peak of 4090 cables burning. The reasons why also including what alternatives. My questions are because i cant seem to find exact answers and hopefuly here someone can inform me well on how to take care of my new 4090 from suffering the same burned pcie cable fate i suppose. I understand alot has been user error, bending and not inserting it correctly including alot of cable mod adapters burning too. There also been cases where they have met every single checkmark and in time the cable still burns. So i just have a handful of questions to finally be able to run this card with out it going in flames.

1- Will any single cable no matter the brand or quality still end up burning even following propper steps? This include cables and adapters or any method done to make sure it doesnt burn but sadly seen they still do because of the strain through time and usage.

2- Theres ton of different versions of the 12VHPWR like my thermaltakes1200psu.  600 watt PCie 12+4 Pin cable. I wanna know what mods can i buy to not have to bend this cable and are very reliable. Ive heard thermal grizzlys livewire is fancy but the build quality is reliable. (Im not sure myself i want opinions. There also mixed too from what ive found. Some say its great some say itll still burn.) Either way id love to hear about any other solid and reliable options that can help my gpu last for a long time with out burning. 

3- Will the 4090 cables still end up melting even if i undervolt the card and try not to go beyond 500 watts as an example? I dont mind sacrifing a bit of performance to ensure it doesnt burn even if its like 10% but still performs very well for what i want at 4k. 

4- This one isnt quite related to the cable but its for the gpu itself. I have a msi suprim liquid aio and i want to mount it in the front. However. I understand id want the pump lines to be down so the air can be at the opposite side of the rad. But my question is about the height of the rad. Do i need my aio radiator to be at a higher position from the gpu? Or it doesnt matter at what level difference they both are? Im thinking of making my aio rad higher than the gpu thinking itll help. I heard its better than the rad being lower than the gpu im not sure myself. 

Sorry to bother in anyway I just been researching for a week and cant truly find solid specific answers that i want for my questions. Including im new to the PC world so i have been investigating a ton but its all average a year old info.

Capiscum going crazy on Chch,CantCme2020,1,nzgardening,0,"Hi all.  First post here. :)   


SHORT VERSION:
I bought a small capiscum seedling just over 2 years ago in Chch.  In last few months it had  major growth spurt & I'm after advice on what to do with it.  Has it outgrown its pot? (don't have & can't afford a bigger pot).   Can it be sold as is - would people even want it?? How much is fair price? 


LONGER VERSION:
In the first 2 years the seedling got to about 40cm tall and kinda stopped growing.   It produced only 1 or 2 fruit each summer, that were small & squat but tasted fine.   So looked healthy but not growing.


After a year I repotted to larger pot, put in sunnier & more sheltered spot, and fed it better. No change.


18 months later (end of summer this year).  It rapidly shot up to 120cm tall.  Heaps of new growth and HEAPS of normal looking fruit.


I'm worried that it's outgrown its pot now & that it's furiously flowering / fruiting because it's under stress (is that even a thing?).


I live in a small property with limited garden, plus we hope to move soonish - hence plants in pots.  I don't have a bigger pot to put the capsicum in (& limited funds / space anyway).


If it does need a bigger home, I'd want to sell it.   I think it's healthy but no expert - bit of leaf damage from when I put up bird netting.   I'm also not sure if other people would like the washing machine plant pot It's in :)  What would be a fair price?  And how to sell?


Will try to add pics.  Thanks for any advice.",05-04-2024

I remember Voldemort and Harry planning an Azkaban breakout, they save everyone and gave them treatment to make them better, I remember one time harry was on Voldemort’s study and asked how the newly rescued were doing and Voldemort said most of them were doing ok only that Bellatrix kept insinuating he wanted sex with him(Voldemort, I remember him saying something like “every time she sees me, she wants to suck my co-“) and harry asks why she even thinks that could happen if it has never happened before, at the lack of response from Voldemort he asks Voldemort if he ever had something with her.

Voldemort didn’t answer so harry takes it a yes and said “you did, didn’t you! “(Or something among those lines), Voldemort then said not to blame him as he was insane at the time. And harry to mock him further procedes to ask if he had a snake face at the time..

Overall it was a funny part meant to be like bickering, I remember it being a time travel or those master of death stories where old harry is in young Harry’s  body, so he was intelligent, cunning, etc.

Seven Adani group firms say received SEBI show-cause notices,Firm_Resident3315,1,ShareMarketupdates,0,"**Good morning, everyone.**

Let's dive into the latest news from the Adani Group:

Seven firms under the Adani Group have found themselves in the spotlight as they received show cause notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Here are the key details:

1. **Notice Recipients:** Adani Enterprises, the flagship company, revealed receiving two show cause notices from SEBI during the January-March 2023 quarter. Additionally, five other Adani firms—Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Transmission, Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar—declared similar notices.
2. **Reason for Notices:** SEBI initiated investigations into alleged violations concerning related party transactions and non-compliance with listing regulations, prompted by allegations from U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.
3. **Business Impact:** While the notices raise concerns, the Adani Group firms have assured that they will not significantly impact their business operations.
4. **Political Ramifications:** This development has sparked renewed political tensions between the opposition Congress party and the ruling BJP regarding the perceived relationship between the Adani Group and the government.

**Summary:** The issuance of show cause notices by SEBI to seven Adani Group firms underscores the regulatory scrutiny surrounding their corporate governance practices and related party transactions. While these notices do not represent final judgments, they reflect SEBI's thorough examination in response to allegations raised against the Adani Group.",05-04-2024

What Alternatives Could There Have Been to Killing Ozai?,One_Parched_Guy,1,TheLastAirbender,0,"I always see people debating whether killing Ozai was the right thing to do but I never see any alternatives being brought up on the side of people who think Aang was in the right. Honestly, as someone who thinks that killing him would have been the better and more responsible move, I would have loved a different “pacifist” outcome to Energybending. I was thinking about it while discussing on another thread and decided to rant about it a little.

I don’t really like Energybending conceptually, at least not with the way it’s introduced and explained. That said, there is another way to take away Ozai’s bending: The Spirit World. We know now that if a Bender physically crosses into the Spirit World, they can still bend. But let’s pretend that this is before LoK and only have the rules that we know of, and assume that even when taken physically to the Spirit World that a Bender cannot bend. 

I think that trapping Ozai in the Spirit World is a fair alternative to killing him, considering that all they do in the show is put him in a jail cell to rot for the rest of his life anyways. How they gain physical access to the Spirit World I don’t know - it can maybe involve the Lion Turtle if we wanted to keep him around in this hypothetical. Of course, there’s also the more boring option of literally just sticking him in one of the Pole tundras like they did with P’li if we take away Energybending.

That’s my pick anyways, what about y’all? What other alternatives do you think could work in a (at least somewhat) kid-friendly way?",05-04-2024

How it’s going vs how it started,Brisket_cat,1,3Dprinting,0,"Yesterday I decided to resurrect my first printer, an Ender 3 V2. Around a year ago, I decided to get an Ender 3 pro and have the two in series using the sonic pad. Turns out, klipper is a PAIN IN THE ASS. Like, REALLY. So, I turned it off, where it’s sat since then gathering dust. But, I recently cleaned my desk and had room for something else. I reinstalled Marlin, and it’s been so much better. So, here she is, my OG Ender 3 V2. I harvested the Sprite pro from the Ender 3 pro, and now it’s a beast. I never really realized just how start and leave it it is before I got a X1C, they’re both very good printers. It sucks that if you really want to do everything you have to spend around 75% of the cost of the printer on sale for a hot end, but it beats spending $2k. ",05-04-2024

Do I have to be sober for a certain amount of time to do ADHD testing at UNR,Mineturtle1738,1,unr,0,"So I was on the waitlist for ADHD testing for almost a year and I finally had my first interview of the diagnosis (that wasn’t the initial intake) I was curious if I had to be sober for a certain period of time. The reason I asked is I tried to do it through Kaiser and they said I had to be sober for 90 days I’m not an alcoholic or a pothead or anything like that but it’s a little too long. (I’ve stayed sober anyways for that reason) however they didn’t say anything so I was wondering if it’s an overall thing or it’s just a Kaiser thing. 

TLDR: kaiser said I have to be sober for 90 days to do testing, UNR didn’t. Do I still have to be sober for that long. (Obviously I can’t show up to the testing high) ",05-04-2024

Too good to be true? (First bike/Trike),theparfaithouse,1,motorcycle,0,"Hello all! New here. I’m getting my first ever bike at 28 and decided on getting a trike due to the added safety and eliminated risk of dropping it. I also plan on driving it long distances, and I heard trikes were more comfortable doing that.

Anyway, I found this trike on Facebook marketplace. The sellers are selling this converted 2007 Honda VTX for 8k & claim it only has 9.9k miles.. The sellers are an old, elderly couple. The wife of the seller claims that she can’t ride the bike due to health issues, & her husband already has a bike and doesn’t want to ride the trike. They also claim that they bought it from a dealership and that it had 1 previous owner whose wife didn’t want the husband riding it anymore, thereby making him sell it to the dealership as a trade-in for something else, I believe. 

Is this too good to be true?? A 14 year old bike with less than 10k miles selling for 8k?? That’s an average of riding 707 miles a year.. Basically nothing.. If I go to check it out, what questions should I ask and what should I look for (inspect?). I already called the seller on the phone and he asked immediately. 

Here was the video they posted on the bike. Any initial thoughts/red flags?

Capiscum going crazy on Chch,CantCme2020,1,nzgardening,0,"Hi all.  First post here. :)   


SHORT VERSION:
I bought a small capiscum seedling just over 2 years ago in Chch.  In last few months it had  major growth spurt & I'm after advice on what to do with it.  Has it outgrown its pot? (don't have & can't afford a bigger pot).   Can it be sold as is - would people even want it?? How much is fair price? 


LONGER VERSION:
In the first 2 years the seedling got to about 40cm tall and kinda stopped growing.   It produced only 1 or 2 fruit each summer, that were small & squat but tasted fine.   So looked healthy but not growing.


After a year I repotted to larger pot, put in sunnier & more sheltered spot, and fed it better. No change.


18 months later (end of summer this year).  It rapidly shot up to 120cm tall.  Heaps of new growth and HEAPS of normal looking fruit.


I'm worried that it's outgrown its pot now & that it's furiously flowering / fruiting because it's under stress (is that even a thing?).


I live in a small property with limited garden, plus we hope to move soonish - hence plants in pots.  I don't have a bigger pot to put the capsicum in (& limited funds / space anyway).


If it does need a bigger home, I'd want to sell it.   I think it's healthy but no expert - bit of leaf damage from when I put up bird netting.   I'm also not sure if other people would like the washing machine plant pot It's in :)  What would be a fair price?  And how to sell?

Any idea of why my ball python won’t climb down?,KCmoo512,1,ballpython,1,"I brought him home from college today and cleaned his habitat and put him inside. He has been on top of this log for a while. I can’t think of why… I used reptibark mixed with loose coconut fiber substrate. A little over a month ago my snake got mites and I was told by the vet that mites often come from substrate bags and that was probably how my snake got them. She recommended me using reptile mats for him and I have been doing that for the last month. Until today. I found that the pads made his habitat smell more and kept less humidity so I switched back today. Before the mites, I used forest floor substrate, but they were out at the store. I am paranoid about mites now and worried that might be the case again. I am worried because he has never done this before. Any ideas of what might be wrong?

粉畜/鹅畜洗白俄罗斯，污蔑乌克兰的话术在历史上完全能一一对应,Kikyo0218,1,real_China_irl,1,"每次当有人把日本侵华战争和俄罗斯入侵乌克兰类比时，总有粉畜跳出来：是乌克兰先动手的。通常会有人举例日本说辞“中国军队了柳条湖铁路”“宛平城有日本士兵失踪”来反驳。这时粉畜会开始量体裁衣来为俄罗斯的侵略洗白。先不论粉畜自行加上补充条件而忽略侵略的定义，在一开始就是荒谬的。即便是粉畜的补充条件，在历史上也有对应的话术。

粉畜这时候会补充：中国有主动寻求对抗日本，主动挑衅日本吗？

然而：“今兹不幸与美英两国肇启兵端，洵非得已，岂朕本愿哉。前者，中华民国不解帝国之真意，妄自滋事，扰乱东亚之和平，终使帝国操戈而起，于兹四年有余矣。幸而国民政府有所更新，帝国与其结善邻之谊，互相提携，而重庆之残存政权，恃美英之庇荫，兄弟倪墙，罔知悔改。美英两国则支援残存政权，助长东亚之祸乱，假和平之美名，逞制霸东方之野心，并进而勾结与国，于帝国之周围增强武备，向我挑衅，并对帝国之和平通商横加阻碍，终于断绝经济关系，给予帝国生存以重大威胁，朕饬政府通过和平谈判恢复事态，虽一再隐忍，而彼方毫无退让之精神，徒事推延时局之解决，近则日益加强起经济军事威胁，企图使我屈从。长此以往，帝国多年来争取东亚安定之努力，势必化为泡影；而帝国之存在，亦将濒临与危殆。帝国势逼处此，为生存与自卫计，惟有毅然奋起，粉碎一切障碍。皇祖皇宗之神灵在上，朕深信尔众庶之忠诚勇武，心能恢弘祖宗之遗业，铲除祸根，确立东亚永远之和平，以保持帝国之荣誉，朕实有厚望焉。” ---天皇宣战诏书


粉畜会继续量体裁衣：中国有屠杀日本裔吗？


然而：“残暴的中国官兵捆绑手无寸铁的日本平民，用斧头等利器砍劈，当场分尸”。此外，妇女悉数被从阴道插入棍棒，男性的阴茎则全砍下来，小肠与内脏纷纷外露，甚至有的遭到剥皮的命运”---《大东亚战争的起因》


“近年来多次引起的不祥事件都源于此。今次事变的起因也正是这种气势，爆发点选在永定河畔，发源于通州神人不可饶恕的残暴事件之因亦由此也。 并且，在中南支，由于支那方面的挑衅性行动，帝国臣民的生命财产已经岌岌可危，我居留民忍着眼泪暂时撤离了多年营建起来的安住之地。


回想起来，事变发生后，帝国隐忍，以不扩大事件为方针，力图和平、局部地处理，对于平津地区支那军屡次的挑战及非法行为，我支那驻军也只是为了确保交通线及保护我国居留民而不得不采取自卫行动。


然而，帝国政府早已提醒南京政府要立刻停止挑衅言行，南京政府不仅不听我们的劝告，反而对我方备战，违反严守的军事协定，不顾一切地北上威胁我支那驻军，而且在汉口上海及其他地方召集士兵，露骨地挑战，在上海终于向我们开炮，对帝国军舰进行轰炸。”---近卫文麿的声明


粉畜继续量体裁衣：日本入侵的领土在历史上属于日本吗？

日本确实没有，但纳粹德国有，领土历史上属于德国，声称德国裔受到迫害，声称是波兰主动挑衅入侵德国，德国是被逼的，德国是为了边界的和平。属于是要素拉满了：


“但泽，走廊地区，连同德国的其他东部地区，被波兰并吞，但最重要的是，居住在那里的德意志少数民族受到最痛苦的虐待。在1919-1920年间，超过一百万的德意志裔人民不得不离开家园。
我一如既往地在这里试图通过和平的修订提案，来改变这一不可容忍的局势。”


“波兰已经挑起了针对但泽自由市的战端。波兰也不准备以任何协商方式以及对双方都有益的方式解决走廊问题了。波兰最终不考虑维护其对少数民族的义务了。”


“有人企图借口说德国人犯下了挑衅行为，以此借口对德国人采取措施。我不知道那些被虐待被绑架的儿童或妇女是如何挑衅的；也不知道那些被以兽性野蛮方式被虐待甚至被杀的人，是怎样能够挑衅的。但是有一件事情我是清楚的：没有一个有荣誉感的大国能够长期容忍这种状态！”


“因为与此同时，波兰对这些调停建议的第一个回答，就是波兰的总动员，紧接着，就是新的暴行。今天夜里，这些事情还在反复进行中。在一个晚上发生21起边界冲突事件之后，今天晚上发生了14起，其中3起极其严重恶劣。“


“ 我保证，法国和德国之间的边界是最终的。我一次又一次地向英国表示友谊，并在必要时提供最紧密的合作。但是，善意不能是单方面的。必须要有对方的回应才行

“我下定决心战斗，直到要么现在的波兰政府或另一个波兰政府，会倾向于建立这种远见。我想消除德国边界的不安全因素，消除那种永远导致内战的氛围。我要确保东部边界上的和平”“这意味着我不想对妇女儿童发动战争。我已向空军下达命令，将打击限制在军事目标上。
”波兰昨天晚上第一次在我们的领土上向普通士兵开火。从5时45分开始我们进行反击！从现在开始，炸弹将以炸弹报复；毒气战将以毒气战回应；谁背离了人道战争的规则，就只能等着我们用同样手段以回敬！我将进行这场战争，直到帝国的安全和权利得到保障为止。”

AITAH for walking out of a 20 year friendship ,earlybird-2301,1,AITAH,0,"I, 33(F) recently ended a 20 year friendship. We were best of friends from school days. We were extremely close knit. We did almost everything together. But last 3-5 years have been Rocky. In 2019, I was just getting out of a bad marriage and had come back to the city where she lives ( it's where my parents live too, so i came back to live with them for the time being till I got back on my feet). For the first time I felt we had grown apart. I found it odd that she had suddenly changed so drastically. I made a few comments about it which didn't go down well with her. We got in a argument about it and I used some terrible words in the heat of the moment which i immediately regretted.After that we patched up. I apologised, she seemingly accepted the apology and then fast forward few years and she randomly brings it up again and throws all the fights we have had over the years back at me. I ended up again apologizing this time in person at her house. Again it seemed like she accepted the apology and so i let it be. I ended up moving cities again (shortly after the in person apology)getting married, getting pregnant, giving birth and through all of that she was still distant and weird. I had too much going on so i gave it some space for a year or so. But I again confronted her early this year and she again brings up all those fights and how i don't understand her or get it. And how i haven't acknowledged it and she tells me how she doesn't know how to process the pain and she is ok with this strained friendship. When I asked her then what she needs me to do, she didn't give me an answer and asked to come up with solutions. I was perplexed, pained and stumped. In my mind i have apologized enough.i even gave her an in person apology. I wasn't ok with a strained distant friendship, so i informed her i want to end the friendship. She said she doesn't want to lose the friendship completely since she has known me most of her life but she wasn't ready to get back to normalcy. I felt it's too painful to have a superficial friendship and i informed her that and walked away blocking her , her family, her friends everywhere on all social media etc. (btw it isn't like she is a saint. Over the course of those 20 years, i have made mistakes but so has she. All those things came rushing back to me when i repeatedly apologized and she still held me at arms length, I was pissed, sad and pained hence the radio silence, blocking and walking out). AITAH?

## 📄 ADVENTURE DETAILS
 
>  There are tales of a far-off land beyond the sea and the horizon. It lies shrouded in mist - an impenetrable barrier that keeps its people contained, never free from its shadowed walls. The myths from the land are wide and varied, with no real consistency as so few that venture there manage to return. Some tales tell of a dark and ancient power ruling the land in an iron-like grasp, cursing all who enter and remain. Others speak of the viciousness of the land, infested with monstrous creatures who mangle and mutilate all who stray off the path through its wilderness. The most prominent tale, however, is that of an immortal ruler, a tyrant that flies like the wind across the sky, enacting laws of her own making and instilling fear into her subjects lest they forget themselves and to whom they belong. These stories come to mind as our adventurers find themselves in a worn-down rowboat, drifting through the dark, murky waters toward the shore of the land of Barovia. The ship you were on refused to venture further into the mists, regardless of the gold offered to her experienced captain. The letter you received was one of mystery. Few details were given of the land you intend to step foot on, yet the letter was brimming with one emotion - fear. A cry for help if there ever was one. And thus, you journey on, not knowing what awaits you in the shadows of Barovia.

> This retelling of Curse of Strahd will be an event you don't want to miss. Spine chilling adventures and the occasional Scooby doo like hijinks await. Grab your seat today.

FIRE corpus didn't hit the Target. Still Retiring,KindAd6637,1,FIRE_Ind,0,"I (45M), single , planned to retire by June this year with a FIRE corpus of 2cr which is 30x my annual expenses. Because of bad investmentments, my corpus is only 1.6cr which is 23x. I have a highly stressful job which has drained my soul. I am sticking to my plan of retiring by June this year. 

As a FIRE aspirant, my worst nightmare is living up to 100 years and my FIRE corpus running out. What do people do to avoid corpus running out that? I don't want to live for  that long. I want to lead a good stress free life after FIRE.

I do work out and eat healthy and after retirement from work my stress would reduce as well and so I may live long. 2 of my grandparents are still alive in their 90s, so longevity is there in my family.

I discussed this with my friends and one of the solutions discussed was to move to a city with high air pollution like Delhi so that lifespan can be reduced by 5-10 years organically.  Or continue staying in Bangalore where traffic stress continues to strike out years from life. I don't want to stop my exercise routines and eat unhealthy just for this. I want to lead an active lifestyle.

I had earlier planned to retire in a tier 2 city but may be I may not be able to afford that if that has an effect of adding years to my life. What do other FIREd people think? What would you do if you unexpectedly live to 100 and your corpus runs out?

Should I give up and start trying with donor eggs?,LiveandLetLive-23,1,IVF,0,"Have been so thankful for this group. Seeking your advice. Should I stop torturing myself and move to donor eggs? I know it is a long road even with a donor, but at 38 I know that if I go down that route now, I’m closing the door on having a child that is genetically related to me.
Background:
I’m a 38 yo F, .78 AMH, no tubes (due to ectopic that required removal), normal uterus. My husband is 38 yo M, normal sperm test.

We have done 4 ER, with no success. The first two were done with a modified natural protocol, first with 9 days of stims 10,000 IU Pregnyl trigger and the second with 10 day stim and 20,000IU Pregnyl trigger + 5000 IU Lupron (12 hours later). The first yielded one embryo, which was transferred fresh on day 3. It did not implant. The second retrieval yielded 2 embryos, the first was transferred on day 5. I was pregnant but HCG values were low to start and I had to have a medical miscarriage at 10 weeks because growth stopped at 6 weeks. We attempted to test the fetal tissue for genetic abnormalities, but the test was not successful. We tried to test the remaining frozen embryo, which was of poor quality, but the genetic test came back as inconclusive. We transferred it a few months later and it did not implant. 
We then switched clinics. We did the first cycle using a Lupron priming protocol, with a 12-day stim and a 10000 IU Pregnyl trigger + 5000 IU oviderl (12 hours later). We got 10 eggs but none were mature. We then did a birth control + antagonist protocol, with 11 days of stims, and 20,000IU Pregnyl trigger + 5000 IU Lupron 12 hours later. We got 4 embryos, but none made it past 6 cell stage. Both clinics suggested that while I could keep trying there is likely a problem with my eggs and they are just not developing normally. I don’t want to try forever, the process has been very exhausting for me, but I feel like if I stop now, this is it.
I have tried to follow the instructions from “It starts with the egg” in terms of supplementation, live a pretty healthy lifestyle (decent good diet and exercise), and have had genetic carrier screening and karyotype testing (both of which were fine). 
If I was your friend, would you advise me to go the egg donor route? If you have been in my shoes, how did you decide? Do you have any suggestions on what else I should try? Thank you so much!! ❤️

[WA] Demoted by new Supervisor ,sspiritshark,1,AskHR,0,"I was promoted to management position in January by my previous supervisor who left the company right after he  gave me the promotion.  A new person took over that role, from a different department in the same company, but she basically started her senior level role a few days after I took on my role. It was also a promotion for her. 

This week she conducted my 3 month review (I’ve been employed here for almost 4 yrs but this was my review for my promotion, she’s only been with the company a little over a year!)

I knew there was going to be some pain points in the review, because I admittedly struggle with some of the more technical and data parts of my job, but I do try and listen to her feedback. When she gives me tasks to do, I get them done. But her problem with that is that I should just “know what to do” without her having to tell me. How does that make sense?

Well, she gave me very low scores on almost every category in the review, put me on a PIP and demoted me back to a non-management position which reduced my pay. She has a very different management style then my previous boss and I feel she unfairly expected me to know more about my new job then I did, but I don’t feel it’s fair to demote me afteronly 3 months, especially when she’s also only been in her role the same amount of time. 

How can she genuinely make that decision if my previous boss made the decision after knowing my work style for over 3 years? Is that ethical?? She is making so many changes to the program and claims that we have been doing things wrong or substandard and we aren’t meeting our basic job description duties. But no one else on the team is being demoted, just me.

I also don’t feel how she’s been communicating to me was adequate in helping me understand her pain points. She throws a ton of information and expectations at us, claiming they’ve always been the expectation based on the “JOB DESCRIPTION”,  but basically what she doesn’t grasp is that is not how the previous supervisor facilitated my role! 

I don’t understand why I am being reprimanded if my previous boss never emphasized or trained me to do these things. HR please explain and help me maybe figure this out in my favor!

I did sign all the documents and job change status forms, hr forms and they did ask if I had any questions at the time or wanted to add feedback or comments to the form, I was so overwhelmed in the moment that I just signed the forms and didn’t add any feedback.

I guess my question is, can I request to adjust the documents or maybe negotiate my demotion? Admittedly I did say I understand where she’s coming from and say I was fine with this, but the more I’ve thought about it and thought about how she hasn’t even been my direct supervisor that long- it just seems wrong and unethical for this decision to be made. 

Yes, one of the human resource assistants was in the meeting, he took notes but didn’t say much until the end when it came time for me to sign the forms and explain the wage change. 

Thank you. Clearly I’m a bit emotional and just seeking advice before e I reach out to rediscuss this with them.

Hmmm but why?,wSOMEBODYw,1,Helldivers,0,"So I had a thought about why the sudden change in policy. It could just be Sony wanting more control over your data. But then I thought about how AH hasn't really been able to solve so many bugs. The bugs that have been here since launch still remain to be in regards to the friend request system, which I guess could be solved if all players connected via PSN. But then there's also the cheaters. AH said they patched the infinite grenade glitch but nope its still there. And with so many data miners leaking content and hackers spawing in content early, I feel like Sony just put their foot down and wants to clean up what AH can't. Which is probably just gonna end up with tons of bans but what else could they do. AH had plenty of time to fix these things and they couldn't. Just makes me wonder if AH was able to fix those issues then would Sony have still implemented this change hmmmm.....

Idk just something I thought about. A sudden change in policy after months of use is pretty intriguing. Although we don't really know what terms exactly Sony and AH have with each other so the reason could be something else entirely. ",05-04-2024

Little concerned about neighbor's activities and strange smells...,ElevatorEastern5232,1,AskLEO,1,"My spanish neighbors used to have other families over and have parties in the backyard like every 3 days, and all weekend.

They turn off ALL their lights at night, no loud music...almost like they're now doing something they don't want attracting attention. A month ago they've moved a small camper in between their home and their fence that separates my back yard from their side yard, and got what sounds like a couple new dogs (they already had 2, all large, breed unknown, but they all get hostile when they hear me in my side or back yard, as if I have no right to be here.). Security? There was about a week and a half of power tools and hammering sounds coming from the camper, almost like they added the camper to their house as another room,..then things quieted down again. Last weekend, there was a strong smell of something like oven cleaner, so strong I had to close my windows. Our houses are separated by about 50 feet, so it's not like we're right up on each other. Right now there's a strong smell coming from their property. Smells like formaldehyde this time. Again, so strong I have to close my windows. I guess this is going to be happening every weekend.

"Intellectualizing your emotions/ Now that I've acquired so much psychology knowledge, I can't seem to stop psychoanalyzing everything",__eden,1,Healthygamergg,1,"I've realized that I can no longer tolerate negative emotions. Instead of using all the psychology knowledge I've acquired on this channel to improve my life, I'm using it as a shield to deflect feeling any negative emotion in the future.

Now when I'm feeling disappointed or frustrated, my brain immediately conjures a possible explanation to why I'm feeling this way. ""must be ptsd from this specific event from my childhood"", ""must be because I'm feeling insecure due to this person"", must be etc. etc. the list goes on. Theoretically this should help with actually processing the negative emotion and make you feel better, but in my case I've gotten too good to the point where I can't actually feel any negative emotion anymore. 

When I fail an important exam I don't really feel disappointment, when a relationship goes wrong I don't feel sorrow, when I lose an expensive possession I don't feel regret, at least not the full weight of the emotion. My brain just write up a analysis report and somehow moves on, and when I look back, my memories are a blur. I am so self aware on a psychological level too, everything that I do I'm always aware of why I'm doing it. 

Even as I type this out now I'm realizing that coming up with these ""explanations"" is probably my own brain protecting itself, probably due to the fact that I'm a busy student who has a lot of stressful things going on and can't afford to fall off track.

But even before the healthy gamer channel, I remember this all started in 9th grade when I was sent to a facility for a eating disorder, and the therapists there basically had me ""explain"" my motivations for not eating, and why I did what I did. And man I used to talk for hours, writing pages and pages just analyzing what went on in my brain. That's basically all I did at the facility for months, and when I actually got better I couldn't get my analyzing abilities to shut up again.

So yea, my brain is basically too self-aware for its own good. How do I fix this?

Moab Kit Quick Review,420curiosity,1,CannabisHardware,0,"Hi All, I got the Moab Essentials Kit and the GooRoo Bubbler on the sale and feel like I owe the people a quick review.

Coming from a Mighty/Tinymight, ball vape is definitely a huge step up. Even the cheap DIY stuff I priced out was an investment, but I like how modular it is. If you are on the fence about a ball vape in general it's good.

The GooRoo bubbler is nice but by no means fancy. It's got a little more branding than I realized but nothing over the top. It strikes a good balance of feeling nice without feeling overly delicate where I need to handle it with kid gloves. I needed something like this and it fit the bill, but I'd probably not pay full price unless you know this is exactly what you want.

As for the Moab bundle specifically:

The Moab itself is great: aluminum block with a familiar AC power cable (and switch), PID, and 25mm axial coil. The top is full of cutouts for accessories and tools. There's also a nested magnet and a threaded deal (I presume for a Clampy, but I can't ever see wanting two coils, myself) and it feels like one, cohesive unit.

The Mercury and shovelhead bowl are both well-made and the fit and all is great. The kit comes with a post, which I clamped onto the shovelhead (fit to the bubbler) and I now consider them one combined unit for all intents and purposes. The wood handles are a nice touch but if I were going a la carte I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I were going for a matching set. The Mercury seems like a lot of money for something so simple that comes in a little ziploc, but it's high-quality and requires no tinkering and trying to build a non-wireless DIY alternative wasn't that much cheaper so I bit the bullet.

Can someone explain if I want to use the banger for something?

The dabber is fine but again not sure I'd order it if I were going a la carte. I'd much prefer it cut in half so I can stick them both in the base.

Overall I'm happy. It was a lot of money but I'm happy to be done regularly dealing with batteries and this seems like a good framework I can build on in the future. I'm glad I got a ""wireless"" setup and am curious to see what happens in this space in the future. The base seems a little overkill for my uses, but maybe I'll grow into it.





Happy to answer questions and always looking to learn more.


Thinking about accessories I want to get, what do people recommend? Thinking...
-Screens (3/4"" cheapies in bulk?)
-Scoop of some sort
-Another/different tool that fits in base
-Portable (nalgene-ish) bubbler?
-Anything else?",05-04-2024
Telling manager about pregnancy,ThiccGoochs,1,LegalAdviceNZ,1,"Hi guys,
I work in a factory, on a shift pattern. It's full of older men and only 3 young women. I have heard f**king awful things said about my coworker whom is pregnant. I'm not one for announcements, but because my job can be quite physically challenging and dangerous I want to tell my manager with confidence that I am pregnant with my first, how ever knowing his personality he will spread my private information like wild fire, and I too will  be subject to derogatory remarks from my male coworkers.

Before I speak to my manager, is there any legal way to ensure he does not disclose my pregnancy to my coworkers without my permission? I genuinely don't think me saying to him ""This is confidential and I don't want you telling anyone"" will suffice. The sooner I let my manager know the better as I stated my job can be quite dangerous especially while pregnant. I'm just nervous about this as I have not told my family or friends yet.

Advice Needed: Enhancing Job Prospects in Programming While Pursuing BTech in CS,Suffered_Heart,1,github,0,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and/or Backend programming. But I could also learn full stack. Till now I’ve used Python at intermediate levels and C++ at beginner levels. I’ve also done some projects on Bash scripting for Raspberry Pi projects. 

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I’d love to hear about them.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and insights!

PS : I’m in India but down to go aboard on my own expense if I get confirmation of employment. 

**TL;DR:** Pursuing BTech in CS, seeking advice on boosting job prospects in programming. Interested in which events and competitions to join, effective networking strategies, the benefits of LeetCode for coding practice, and which certifications and skills are most valuable. Open to opportunities abroad with confirmed employment. Appreciate any insights on internships and extracurricular activities. Thanks!

93일 - 스페인어 발표,zestaram,1,WriteStreakKorean,0,"오늘은 2024년 5월 3일입니다. 5월에 동안 제일 바쁠 날을 오늘 지낸 것 같습니다. 과학 수업에서 과제를 실험하고, 역사 수업에서 어저께 그것에 대해 쓴 지도 퀴즈를 봤고, STEM 수업에서 만든 대교를 실험하고 했기 때문에 바빴습니다. 그렇지만 그것과 비교하면 스페인어 수업에서 한 것은 상상할 수 없게 큰 것이었습니다. 학년이 끝나가고 있어서 다른 수업과 똑같이 스페인어 수업도 새로운 것을 배우기를 마무리했고 스페인어 말하기 기말고사를 위한 준비를 하고 있습니다. 그 준비를 위해 노력을 쏟기 전에 생각이 맞으면 마지막으로 스페인어를 쓰는 나라에 대한 과제를 해야 했습니다. 어디에 갈 것인지, 어떻게 갈 것인지, 뭐를 쌀 것인지, 도착하면 뭐를 보나 구경할 것인지, 배가 고프면 어떤 문화적인 음식을 먹을 것인지에 대해 발표를 해야 했습니다. 이번 주 내내 수학 기말고사를 한 날을 빼며 그 과제를 위해 준비를 했고 오늘이 다른 학생들 앞에 발표하는 날이었습니다.

평소에는 성이 A로 시작하는 학생들과 시작하시고 Z까지 하시는데 오늘은 거꾸로 Z로 선생님이 시작하셨습니다. 그것을 봤을 때 모두 깜짝했고 첫 번째로 발표해야 한다고 밝히며 준비할 시간이 많을 것이라고 믿은 학생이 정신없이 외우지 않았던 몇 줄을 외우려고 했습니다. 그리고 학교 종이 울린 당시에 발표가 시작했습니다. 로마자에 저의 이름은 알파벳의 중간에 있었으니 두려웠고 빨리 처리하고 싶었는데 기다려야 했습니다. 몇 명이 필요한 슬라이드를 내지 않아서 그들을 위해 더 많이 기다려야 했는데 수업의 반이 지났을 때 드디어 저의 차례가 왔습니다. 안정하기 위해 한숨을 쉬고 발표를 시작했습니다. 생각했던 것보다 더 잘 하고 있었는데 발표의 반에 선생님이 다른 슬라이드로 바꾸시고 저한테 괜찮고 앉아도 된다고 말씀하셨습니다.

선생님이 왜 그래셨는지 헷갈리시면 괜찮습니다. 지금 듣고 있는 스페인어 수업은 쉬운 단계이며 저는 이미 스페인어를 원주민과 같이 말할 수는 없지만 매일 대화는 큰 문제 없이 할 수 있기 때문에 발표 등을 할 때 선생님이 원하시는 것보다 더 많이 말하는 버릇이 있습니다. 그러니 이미 많이 발표했다고 생각하셨기 때문에 그만하라고 하셨습니다. 그렇지만 이미 스페인어를 할 수 있고 쉬운 수업이면 왜 두려웠는지 궁금해하실 수 있습니다. 솔직히 그것의 대답은 저도 모릅니다. 쉽고 큰 일이 없이 통과할 것이라고 이미 알고 있지만 어떤 이유 때문에 계속 쓸데없이 무서웁니다. 하는 것을 다 완벽히 하고 싶는 것 때문인지, 단순히 몸이 그러는지, 왜 그렇게 반응하는 것인지 모르겠습니다. 그것은 몰라고 이것은 압니다. 선생님이 저를 끊으셨을 때 아무도 깜짝 놀라지 않았습니다.

저의 글을 고쳐 주시면 감사하겠습니다.",05-04-2024

You’re Not A Hostage: When Peers Want You Prisoner,Erwinblackthorn,1,TDLH,0,"The term “clinically online” is something I feel is painfully underused. Clinically, critically, whichever it may be. People are succumbing to their addictions, with their smartphone or tablet delivering a deadly drug of the utmost potency. This drug delivers with it, through a poisonous blue light, a hypnotic trance that removes the world around its hopeless victim. A victim made by their own hand and intentionally through their own misguided reasons.

While some are crafting their own padded cell with pixels and code, others are seeking power and free labor in their own merriment through the meadow of madness. There is no rhyme or reason for their desires, yet they will spend months, even years, plotting and planning to seek someone to hold against their will. This entrapment begins in the form of friendship, usually through love bombing, with their victim falling for it every step of the way. Cults are everywhere, they can be started by anyone, and anytime someone enters one they are certain they are immune to them. Online activity has normalized cultist behavior through many means.

Politics, media, online personalities, false movements, gurus, fandoms. It’s impossible to keep track of all of them or how many people have fallen to them. Not only that, but there is another lesser known threat that is to be known as the hostage holder. This one is a lot more present but less talked about for how passive and personal it can be. There is also a factor of how tight a relationship can be online, due to the lack of physical contact.

When you meet someone in person, you create an exchange of interests to strengthen your relationship, causing the relationship to be balanced and harder to take advantage of others. If, for example, you give money to a friend, they are more likely to give it back because they see you every day. You can also take something from them, creating a massive web of lending and borrowing, removing the barrier between their property and yours. Some friendships act as sexless marriages, with the intensity of closeness being to where they can trust each other at their most vulnerable. The whole point of creating such a relationship is to create a balance of trust that intertwines two lives together for partnership and companionship.

When it comes to art, you will encounter numerous “peers” who treat themselves as even or equal in your field of experience. They will begin as a spark of interest, sharing a similar goal with others who seek the same process of production. You’ll find people in need of things, of labor and contact, of skills and abilities. They will ask you to borrow things that you can’t get back: your precious seconds of life. So many of these hostage holders will use emotional attacks to get what they want, either by appearing pathetic or timid to make any backlash against them seem unwarranted. 

I’ve had several occasions in my past where someone proposed an option that sounds too good to be true: help in a project and I could get a share of profits. Because I would be doing a big chunk of the work, I would get a big chunk of the share. Obviously, none of these proposals went through, and I used these people to practice my abilities. Art, writing, concepts, marketing, whatever I felt like doing in my free time. While they were trying to use me, I was trying to use them, making these situations feel mutual.

Later on, I realized how crazy these people are to propose such a situation in the first place. To even ask a stranger for free labor, from anyone, to get nothing done, is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard of. They want to run a business on legal slavery, manipulating people with vague promises of profit that will never exist. This practice has been normalized online through DIY circles, that turned more into a “you do it for me” type of mentality. And I would safely make the generalized declaration that… we all know people like this.

My theory is that fake artists are controlled by an inner child that clings to their most needy of needy personas. Their inner infant that holds its hands out and demands everything, to give nothing in return. Their goal is to take, not to gain, because their brain has not developed a process of profit yet. The “muse” can be considered a partner in crime with this neediness, but I would say this is more of a danava. Part of the asura, the leader of danava is called Vritra, the personification of drought.

Drained of water, deprived of fluidity, lack of life, lack of progression, the cause of mass death.

When you encounter this drought, you must doubt. Always doubt the homeless salesman who’s begging people to work now to be paid never. When they say “you’ll be paid when we make sales”, you’ll have to consider if that’s your choice for any other job. Always look at your time as if you’re to be paid your current wage for it. What do you make per hour? 

What else can you do with your time?

These people are not stupid, they know how to blind you from reality. They’re only stupid when they try to capture someone who knows their trick. These are the people that scream the loudest when you say no, they hide the deepest when you give a sign that you’re onto them. Blocking, demonizing, gaslighting, we’ve all seen this from the same types of people. And for what, exactly?

They wanted to take your time, your money, your power, and you said no. When fake artists cry about you being mean, become more cold. When they tell others that you’re no fun, slap them down with logic. Make it blunt, make it clear; they hate this. If you see them trying to take advantage of you, instead take advantage of them.

These are not quite predators, but foxes in the forest, searching for abandoned eggs to devour. They hope their crafty nature and charm is enough to keep people around, usually holding such at a surface level. They pretend their efforts are important, in hopes others accept the illusion spell. Postmodernism becoming the norm has normalized the dark triad, convincing people it’s no longer dark as long as they can create a good enough excuse for becoming an artificial psychopath or narcissist. Online activity amplifies this behavior, trapping it in an echo chamber, leaving a history of normal people engaged in an abnormal environment.

It’s not just tiny circles like authortube or fake movements that will trap people in these hostage situations. It can extend into political parties and corporate overreach, with interlopers pretending they were the original form all along. Then they will demand that you appeal to their emotions, you must do as they say, you must speak their language, or else you’re to be exiled. The second you validate that form of insanity is the second you are held hostage by the hostage holder. When it comes to the personality traits of OCEAN, the feminine types of people are more likely to fall for this trap, because they are high in agreeableness.

The feminine types of people are usually artists, highly emotional, impulsive, always led by vague ideas instead of concrete concepts. They will have a dream(or make one up to be dramatic) in order to convince others that they must help them reach their dream. People high in agreeableness and altruism will follow this vague idea, not even questioning why that is any of their business to begin with. If you are to take a moral from this story, it is this: NEVER be nice. Make everyone understand that you are never going to give them any charity.

If you do give them charity, it’s to hurt their feelings, and rightfully so.

These hostage holders are all the same. They will pretend they are “just doing their own thing”, talk about big dreams of being big, collect a circle of feminine underlings, and abuse them to no end. Businesses do this as well, with things like points and warnings.

“You better not act up again, or else you’re going to get a warning. Get 3 of them and you’re fired!”

They want people who are worried about losing their job, they beg for it.

“You said things that hurt my feelings. Do that again, and I’ll never talk to you.”

They want you to care about their feelings, without giving you a reason to care.

We were trained to fall for this at a young age with our parents and our schooling. They know this. That’s why they copy the same tone and tactics. This is why you have to be stronger than them, never see them as an authority, and make sure they hate you. You want these types to never bother you again, never even try to trap you.

Your goal is to live your life, uncompromised, with your own personal advantage placed first. When it’s your time, it’s to be used for yourself. When it’s your money, it’s to be used for yourself. When it’s your power, it’s to be used for you to gain more power. Never give the hostage holder your power, because you’ll never see it again.",05-04-2024

Ubuntu AMD FW13 recently got more unstable - hardware issue?,kowalski71,1,framework,0,"I've been using my AMD FW13 for about 4 months perfectly happily. I was on Ubuntu 22.04 for most of that and it's been very stable. A few days ago I had a very weird crash: the mouse and a bunch of UI elements turned into blocks, it went unresponsive. I hard rebooted it and it started not asking for a password to login ever. I thought that was weird and something about my install must have gotten corrupted so I did a fresh clean install to Ubuntu 24.04. But it's still been weirdly unstable. I've had a handful of full crashes and freezes, especially when coming in and out of sleep or plugging in a USB-C dock. Sometimes just a freeze and I have to reboot but sometimes crashes to a black screen with a bunch of read/write IO errors ([image of error screen](https://imgur.com/wurofoE)).

Unfortunately, I chose a bad therapist who spent the rest of the appointment trauma dumping about her childhood molestation. I have not gone back to therapy since.

"Please help me cope, I lost my childhood dog",Organic1222,1,Petloss,1,"Hi everyone, listening to your stories has helped me realize i’m not alone. So here’s mine:

My baby boy named Happy, was 17 yrs old (yes I know he lived a very long and full life), but that doesn’t change how much this hurts me. I had him from when I was 5 yrs old. I grew up with him. I don’t remember life without my angel baby. It was all so sudden, about 1 week ago things started going downhill. The vet said he has a heart murmur and he is a very old dog, and gave the option of putting him down. I couldn’t come to terms with that. About 6 days later he was on his daily walk with my dad, and he just fell over on the street. His heart was beating really fast, until it didn’t, then he was dead. During this time, my parents called me and I got home within 2 minutes, I was crying like a crazy person. When I finally got home, he woke up. It was like a miracle. But, after this event, I knew his time was near. I was having panic attacks every second, thinking that any moment now can be my baby’s last moments. The next day, me and my dad took him to the park (for the last time), he wouldn’t eat or drink water, later that night he passed away in my mom’s arms. They buried him in our backyard and didn’t tell me until it was done. 

I got home broken, shattered, and absolutely wrecked. I couldn’t sleep. My baby is gone, and I feel so alone. I am the only one who can’t seem to “move on”. It’s only been 3 days, how have my parents “moved on”???? He was my dad’s best friend, and he was my baby. I can’t go into the kitchen where his bed and food bowls were (it’s empty there now). I can’t stop crying. I need help. Please tell me what to do to become normal again. I’m in so much pain.
I know he is no longer in pain, and he is in a better place. but I can’t imagine living without him…

Exploring the Ethics of Autonomous Robots.,ThatsSuperCoolFr,1,RobotRenaissance,0,"Robotics is revolutionizing healthcare, offering innovative solutions to complex medical challenges. Surgical robots, for example, are transforming surgeries with greater precision and improved outcomes. They perform minimally invasive procedures with smaller incisions, leading to reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and fewer complications.

Rehabilitation also benefits from robotics, with robotic exoskeletons helping patients regain mobility after injuries or strokes. These wearable robots assist with walking and movement, providing support and feedback for improved strength and coordination.

Beyond surgery and rehabilitation, robots aid in medication delivery, patient monitoring, and eldercare. While the benefits are clear, challenges include cost, integration, and ensuring patient safety and privacy. Despite these, the future of healthcare robotics looks promising, with continued advancements set to transform the industry further.

**Ethics: Exploring the Ethics of Autonomous Robots**

The rise of autonomous robots, such as vehicles and drones, raises important ethical questions. One key issue is accountability in accidents: who is responsible, the manufacturer, the programmer, or the robot itself?

Another concern is the decision-making algorithms used by autonomous robots. How do we ensure these decisions are ethical, especially in dilemmas like saving pedestrians versus vehicle occupants?

There are also concerns about the societal impact, such as job loss due to autonomous vehicles. Ensuring fair distribution of benefits and minimizing harm to certain groups is essential.

These complex questions require careful consideration and discussion as autonomous robots become more prevalent in our lives. Addressing these ethical issues is crucial to their responsible and ethical use.",05-04-2024

Parent won’t file taxes & other parent has high income,Virtual-Ad-2647,1,FAFSA,0,"I’m a junior at a UC in an engineering program college living my with my mom. I commute 75 miles round trip 5x a week. My parents have been divorced for a decade. 

My mom makes $116,000 this year and I made $3,300 this year and I stopped working. I made $30,000 in 2022 and my mom made $96,000. I wanted to try to appeal because my income dropped significantly but my moms praised so much that I barely have a $10,000 drop. 

This already shoots me $2000 above Calgrant A (Our household is 2 people, $117,000 is the limit) so I thought I would use my Dad’s income this year. My Dad does not file his taxes I guess and he does not plan on it. I’m not sure what’s the history or why it’s all new to me but I feel stuck. 

This year I qualified for loans to cover only 75% of my tuition each quarter leaving me paying over $3000 out of pocket. I feel so hopeless. I’m running out of money and the commute is wearing on me. 

Does anyone have any advice? My mom takes home a fraction of her actual income because she has no dependents.

[M4F] Monster Girl Rp                                 ,Zatguy0,1,roleplaying,0,"


I’m looking for someone to play out a monster girl themed Rp for me. 

One idea that I had in mind for plot, was a sort of revenge quest: after my home is ransacked and destroyed, I set out for revenge with the surviving monster girl, encountering others among the way. 
Another idea I had was to leave home for a quest to prove myself with one of the monsters accompanying me.
Or maybe I rescue you from a carnival or a slaver. 
There’s also the “waking up in another world” type Rp.
There needs to be some kind of story, straight smut gets boring. 

If you had any ideas, don’t hesitate to say so, I’d love to hear!

Limits and such can be discussed later, but know that I’m not into tentacles, hyper, vore, transformation, inflation, bdsm, oviposition, hypnosis, or non con.

Please no “text talk”. (“ur”, “u”, etc.)

I am 18+ and every person and character involved with this rp must also be 18+",05-04-2024

I did IT with my sister and I regret it.,SadLittleAlt,1,TrueOffMyChest,0,"I (20M), did it with my sister, (22F) and I regret it.

A few months ago my sister went out with some friends to a bar and she had called me later in the night to come pick her up. She had rode with some friends there and apparently they left her at the bar.

I agreed and drove there to pick her up. She didn't seem blackout drunk but definitely  more than tipsy. When she got in the car she thanked me and things started normal but got progressively weirder.

She was touching my thigh and acting really flirty. I was grossed out but didn't say anything. I drove her home and she begged me to come inside because she wanted company. Again I felt weird but went in anyway. I sat on the couch and she jumped on me. She was laying all over me and I tried getting her off but she didn't move.

That's when she kissed me and I didn't know how to feel. I tried pushing her off but she was really persistent. I just sat there. I didn't move anymore and I just let it happen.

She grabbed my crotch through my pants and I got a boner. She noticed it and offered to help to which I declined because I planned to leave but she was already trying to take my shorts off. I didn't know what to do but I just... let her. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other.

She fell asleep afterwards and I left. I promised myself to never tell her because why would you? How would you even start that conversation? How would she react? I don't want my family ruined or to be disowned.

Bev has a boyfriend and, A: I don't want to ruin that, and B: she's pregnant. They're so excited about having a baby but I'm like 99 percent sure it's mine. I'm freaking out. Reddit help me. What do I do? Should I tell her?",05-04-2024

Since surgery I have no feeling other than in pinky (separate nerve) and half of ring finger. I can’t move fingers unless with my other hand and I can’t feel my partner touching it.

Advice Needed: Enhancing Job Prospects in Programming While Pursuing BTech in CS,Suffered_Heart,1,MachineLearningJobs,1,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and/or Backend programming. But I could also learn full stack. Till now I’ve used Python at intermediate levels and C++ at beginner levels. I’ve also done some projects on Bash scripting for Raspberry Pi projects. 

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I’d love to hear about them.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and insights!

PS : I’m in India but down to go aboard on my own expense if I get confirmation of employment. 

**TL;DR:** Pursuing BTech in CS, seeking advice on boosting job prospects in programming. Interested in which events and competitions to join, effective networking strategies, the benefits of LeetCode for coding practice, and which certifications and skills are most valuable.

## 📄 ADVENTURE DETAILS
 
>  There are tales of a far-off land beyond the sea and the horizon. It lies shrouded in mist - an impenetrable barrier that keeps its people contained, never free from its shadowed walls. The myths from the land are wide and varied, with no real consistency as so few that venture there manage to return. Some tales tell of a dark and ancient power ruling the land in an iron-like grasp, cursing all who enter and remain. Others speak of the viciousness of the land, infested with monstrous creatures who mangle and mutilate all who stray off the path through its wilderness. The most prominent tale, however, is that of an immortal ruler, a tyrant that flies like the wind across the sky, enacting laws of her own making and instilling fear into her subjects lest they forget themselves and to whom they belong. These stories come to mind as our adventurers find themselves in a worn-down rowboat, drifting through the dark, murky waters toward the shore of the land of Barovia. The ship you were on refused to venture further into the mists, regardless of the gold offered to her experienced captain. The letter you received was one of mystery. Few details were given of the land you intend to step foot on, yet the letter was brimming with one emotion - fear. A cry for help if there ever was one. And thus, you journey on, not knowing what awaits you in the shadows of Barovia.

> This retelling of Curse of Strahd will be an event you don't want to miss. Spine chilling adventures and the occasional Scooby doo like hijinks await. Grab your seat today.

I posted here after. I keep trying to make music, but it never works. I'm willing to try it again because I REALLY want to create something.

I'm looking to create something melancholic, weird, and emo-driven kinda of music. I'm a sucker for Midwest emo, folk, metalcore, sadcore, and so on.

My main influences are Jeff Buckley, American Football, Elliott Smith, Angel Olsen, Carissa's Weird, Faith no More, My Heart to Joy, etc.

Or...

We could create something different.

Will choosing a community college harm my career prospect ?,fox_mulder321,1,AskAcademia,0,"I am currently a visiting assistant professor of physics and astronomy at a liberal arts university and in the job market since my university decided not to renew my contract due to budget cuts. I joined as a VAP immediately after completing my PhD. 

So far I have only received one job offer and it’s from a community college. The pay is decent, actually more than my current salary. They want me to sign the offer letter in 10 days. Other places where I have interviewed and relatively hopeful about getting an offer are all one year visiting positions at liberal arts colleges. 

I am on F-1 OPT which is expiring soon and therefore doesn’t have the luxury of time. The uncertainty is giving me lots of anxiety.

My current plan is to accept the offer, add few years of teaching experience, continue doing my research and then look for tenure track/ permanent positions at R2 universities/ SLAC.

Do you think working at a community college would permanently harm my career prospects?

Got a new gig as a System Administrator a few weeks back. It's a relatively small company - supporting around 150 users.

After making all these changes, he then informed me to fix all these issues with the end users who are frantically putting in tickets and calling in saying they can't login to their apps.

I warned him not to make such radical changes like this and that we need to test extensively before we proceed on.He blatantly ignored me and did the changes anyways.

I did this to learn how to tell when these chords come in and what signifies the chord im currently hearing like the base note or when the chord changes. When playing a long the chords sound like they fit, but when double checking to see what tabs online say its a completely different. In the live version of i want to hold your hand i see john play on the verse G-A-Em-B with a 
blues esque shuffle on G and A. I play that to both the live and studio recording and it fits. Problem is tabs im seeing else where say different chords while in the same key like G-D-Em-B.

Noong Aug 26, 1878 ilang araw bago mai-publish ang ginamit niyang artikulo na ""The personality of God"" series ay napag usapan nila Canright at mag asawang James at Ellen White (parehong naniniwala na si Kristo ay Diyos) ang paggawa nyan kasama na ang artikulong ""the divinity of Christ"" (photo2).
https://documents.adventistarchives.org/Periodicals/RH/RH18780822-V52-09.pdf

“By this we see that a very plain and great distinction is made between the Son and all the angels. They are all commanded to worship him. No created being can ever be worthy of worship, however high he may be, neither would it be right nor just for God to bid one order of his creatures to worship another. Divinity alone is worthy of worship, and to worship anything else would be idolatry. Hence Paul places Christ far above the angels, and makes a striking contrast between them.” 
D.M. Canright, Review and Herald, June 18, 1867

“Jesus Christ was God’s own, yea, only divine Son, begotten of the Father’s own substance. He was not a created being like men or angels… Indeed, it was Christ the Son, who created this earth; yes, and all the worlds on high, Heb. 1. Not only so, but Christ created the angels themselves. Col. 1:15. He is a divine Being, infinitely higher than the highest angel; yet the Father is higher than he. Hear Christ’s own language: “My Father is greater than I” John 14:28. Again, “The Son can do nothing of himself.” John 5:19. Again, “I live by the Father.” John 6:57. 

“All that Christ is the Father hath made him. Thus Jesus said, “All power is given unto me in Heaven and in earth.” Matt. 28:18. Who gave it to him? The Father. Then the Father is a distinct person, greater than the Son, but Christ is truly his Son; hence a divine Being.”
D. M. Canright, Review and Herald – November 1, 1877

“If our position be correct, that Christ is truly the Son of God, begotten of the Father’s own substance, then of course it would be proper for him to take the name of his Father, that is God.”
D. M. Canright, Signs of the Times – May 30, 1878

💫if your seeing this it is for you💫 taking down within 48hours,Ok-Cattle-9068,1,SpiritualAwakening,0,"The next part of a spiritual awakening is learning that essentially you are in complete control of your reality & experience in life. 
Your at a cross road once you've had your awakening. You are now open to the truth. You understand you can LITERALLY CREATE the life you desire to live.  
It is your life. No one else's. Stop focusing on others. Don't go online. Dont worry about what others think of you or how they are living. Live YOUR life. You are your main character. 

That's the cross road. Do you continue down the same path with knowledge of the fact that you can change it and remain a victim? Or do you use your knowledge now and free yourself from your old life, start living the life you want & become a victor?

You should have all your attention on yourself. If you really want to help others you need to become your best self. You can only genuinely pour from a glass that is full or overflowing. F social media. F all distractions. This is your life, you focus on you because you are living your dreams and experiencing your desires. How beautiful right. It is your BIRTHRIGHT to live THE BEST life you can imagine. Your dream life IS MEANT TO BE ACHIEVED. That's why you have that vision inside of you. 

Just putting this up because most people on a spiritual journey or after a awakening they remain in this stagnant disassociated trauma state. And there lives get worse not better. I'm telling you now though you need to move towards your desires. That's why all this has happened. Remaining stagnant makes it worse. There is only one timing & that's divine timing & divine timing is always perfect. You cannot remain stagnant though otherwise all this pain and shaking within your life is for nothing. This is just growing pains. You are meant to be what you desire. You are meant to have all the money in the world. Your health is meant to be abundant. All your relationships romantic, family, or friends are meant to be overflowing with love & laughter. Your life is meant to be worth living. You have to move though. You need to be actively moving in a direction. You cannot be still. Otherwise you will regress and not make progress. It will get worse for you. More and more torturous untill you make that change. You know I am right because this is what you are experiencing. This is why you are reading this because it is a call to action. You have to remember life is always moving and you are life so unless you DELIBERATELY choosing to move forward you are moving backwards. 

So this is the next step you take. You write down everything you want to do and accomplish. I mean everything. Every little generous giving gesture you wish to do. People you want to help. Cars, houses, clothes you want to buy. Whatever vision you have you write down. Get it all out of your head. Make everything clear. How much you want to earn. How you want to look. See what it all looks like. Feel what it all feels. Connect the emotion with the thought as much as you can and live from that place as much as you can. Talk with others, drive, listen to music, walk, exercise, as you go to sleep, as soon as you wake up, in the shower, brushing your teeth, on the toilet, watching a movie hold that emotion Every moment. Within 30 days youll be absolutely astonished with what your life is like. The feeling literally comes to life. This is how I changed my life.  And with other techniques. I'm making just under 8 figures yearly now. And well and truly above 700k every month. My daily income is more then I ever earnt in my entire life prior to this journey. More then most peoples yearly salary. More then some will see in their bank account there entire life. Now I do go on reddit here n there n what not but I'm in control and I am aware. 

Anyway I'm putting this up because I was once in the helpless and hopeless position alot of people on here are in. I deliberately used techniques to self hypnotise and change my life. I saw the life I am currently living in everyway before it happened. And because of my dedication to my growth I reached my goals within 9 months. It's all within you. 

I'm leaving this up for 48-72 hours. Because whoever resonates with it will see it then.",05-04-2024

2. They didn't mention some of the thermal pads on the backplate (but maybe I can salvage that with leftover pads I have).

What should I do here? I've already bought this block and I can't refund. The card is torn down and I don't have replacements for some of them atm. I have no idea what block IS compatible with this card.

Why is KHEAA saying my income exceeds amount allowed when I have way less money than before?,Elliot_The_Idiot7,1,college,0,"I earned KEES money last year that automatically went to my tuition. I didn't apply for it or anything because I was using the GI bill and didn't need it, it just automatically goes towards my tuition if I get good grades. It's like a state funded program. 

This year it says that I've received no money because ""my income exceeds the amount allowed"". But this upcoming year is when I actually NEED that money because the gi bill only covers 4 years, and to finish my degree, I have to take a fifth. Why does KHEAA suddenly think I have too much money when I clearly don't, and last year I actually DID have plenty of money for the school year, and they awarded me something anyway?

E-Scholars VS REP dilemma !!,Clear_Technician2921,1,SGExams,0,"Hii, i know there are a lot of posts regarding the same topic but my queries are abit more different so here you go! So i was offered NTU REP and NUS escholars programme (both with scholarship) which im incredibly blessed to have. I am currently leaning towards REP because that’s what i’ve aimed for for a long time but didnt expect to get into escholars. regardless, i still want to evaluate both options so id appreciate any help i can receive

1. i’m under the assumption that escholars will be more taxing than rep so some students finish their bachelors in four years instead of three. Are students still allowed to continue their masters even if they took four years for bachelor? 

2. How many escholars are there for each batch and do all of them stay in rc4? 

(ik rep lets you choose your specialisation in the second year but for escholars im in the regular engineering track so i also can choose later on so that’s not an issue for me. furthermore i think ill enjoy both the curriculum of rep and escholars because both are interdisciplinary because im in nusc) 

the only thing that makes me consider escholars more is that 
1. i got into nusc which is more comfortable than ntu dorms and there are meal plans which is more convenient for me as i have many allergies compared to ntu where we have to outsource our own meals 


yeah so these are just the thoughts in my head, would appreciate any advice i can get ",05-04-2024

Renewal Question - Help Center Ain't Helpful,nestledtogether,1,godaddysupport,0,"Hello, I am a couple months away from renewal with GoDaddy, but it is so unclear exactly what will be renewing and at what rate. Their pricing page is a mess, their chat is non-existent, and I can't find anything on their ""My Account"" pages. I'm only posting here because it's the middle of the night and if I can call anyone tomorrow, I want to have a better understanding before I get bamboozled into a costly annual subscription lol

So, I purchased my domain for the first time in November 2023 and got the products listed below:

* .COM Domain Registration - $11.99
* Full Domain Protection - $9.99
* Website + Marketing with Email - $13.90
* Websites and Marketing Starter - $(3.88) (Renews annually)
* Microsoft 365 Email Essentials- $(10.02) (Renews annually)
* Fees - $0.18
* Total - $36.06

From what I am understanding, the .COM domain will renew at $21.99/year which sounds fine to me. The Full Domain Protection I may cancel.

The issue I am facing: I want to keep the email address I've created, but I don't care about the website or marketing services. I'm confused how I switch to just keeping the email address. If I look in my Admin portal, just the starter email is $4.33/mo ($51.90/yr). But then when I go to the Pricing page on their website, the price is $7.99/mo ($95.88/yr). Does anyone have any clarity on which pricing is actually charged?

Or, alternatively, keeping the Website + Marketing with Email bundle - does anyone know what the pricing on that is? Is that potentially more cost effective? I really don't have any marketing or website activity right now, so my main concern is keeping the business email cost effective. Thank you!",05-04-2024

"Galadriel was banned from Valinor, and Gil galad never had authority to send people to Valinor. Everything in the show feels so forcefully contrived and contradictory to everything tolkien wrote. ",Ok-Design-8168,1,RingsofPower,1,"This is one of the most basic things to know if you say you’ve read tolkien. And yet the showrunners who claim to be big fans seem absolutely clueless about such basic rules in Tolkien’s world. 

How could Showrunners mess up a basic important thing - Gil galad never had any authority to decide who could enter valinor, especially no authority to send someone like galadriel to valinor ad she was banned from entering into valinor. 

The entrance to valinor would never appear for Galadriel- as she was banned. 

Everything from start to finish feels so forcefully contrived and so contradictory to Tolkien’s writings. 

It is one thing to make changes like swapping characters for action sequences - like swapping arwen for glorfindel and having haldir at helms deep in movies. But to completely change the rules of middle earth is simply ridiculous. 

It just shows inexperience and lack of tolkien knowledge of the showrunners. They fired tom shippey only to completely mess up the most basic things from Tolkien’s writings. Real shame at how bad their original writing was and how far from Tolkien’s writings everything in the show is. ",05-04-2024

Legislative bill will delay broadband expansion - potential hearing Saturday 5/4,RiverHowler,1,boulder,0,"A bill backed by big labor unions associated with industry (Comcast, Lumen, Century Link, Verizon, AT&T, etc.) has passed house and headed to senate in Colorado to require rural ISP, local governments and nonprofits to follow labor standards of large corporations offering internet services. If it passes the Colorado Broadband Office will have to stop the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment process and get approval from the National Telecommunications Information Administration taking about 6-9 months. Communities won't have access to 826M until 2025 and construction delated to 2026. These requirements delay and increase costs for cities to construct critical infrastructure.  It is a last minute bill with the legislative session ending on May 8th and a potential Finance Senate Committee Hearing Saturday May 4th TBD. This requires rural ISP and local governments deploying broadband to meet requirements of large corporations. The Colorado Broadband Office would have to become a telecom enforcement agency. 

Read the bill: [https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1245](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1245)

Others probably know better how to see if the hearing gets scheduled tomorrow(5/4) and how to testify. But here is the finance committee chair's email if you have an opinion to share on why broadband deployment and funding: [kyle.mullica.senate@coleg.gov](mailto:kyle.mullica.senate@coleg.gov).

How to access Brokerage account instead of Retirement Account.,Better-Performance81,1,Schwab,0,"Like the title says. I am having issues accessing my brokerage account.

I’m so confused about cleaning equipment,PopLegitimate2207,1,CysticFibrosis,0,"I am seeing and hearing so many different opinions and guidelines on properly cleaning nebulizer equipment. 

My sister has a lung disease called primary ciliary dyskinesia that mimics CF, and she has been in and out of the hospital the last 6 years with multiple pneumonias. She just returned home after being in the hospital/transitional care for 3.5 months (her longest stent yet). With that, we are trying to prevent her from getting any more infections. In the past, my mom has sterilized the equipment by boiling water on the stove and pouring it over the equipment in a bowl right before the (keep in mind she didn’t let it sit in there either…just went straight into treatment). Then after the treatment, she would just let the stuff be used until the next treatment when she would boil water again, and so on. She then was told about a year ago by a respiratory therapist that she could just use distilled water instead of boiling water every time. 

Upon my sister’s recent discharge home last week, I started doing more research and a lot of websites were saying that you need to wash with Dawn dish soap and then rinse and then let air dry after every single treatment (which is 4x per day). I had my mom do this, but then when I was talking to someone I know who is a cardiac ICU nurse, he said at their hospital they do not use soap as it could harbor bacteria if not rinsed off well, and they only use distilled water and let air dry to clean their equipment. 

To me, it just doesn’t make sense that you can clean something without using soap as I keep thinking of the pepper in water analogy where you stick your finger in a bowl of water and pepper (the germs) and you get pepper on your finger whereas if you drop some dawn dish soap in the bowl, the pepper goes to the edges of the bowl, and you stick your finger in, and the pepper comes off. That’s why I feel like we should be cleaning her equipment with soap to get all the bacteria off. But I have had that nurse and then even her current home health respiratory therapist said just distilled water rinse between each use and air dry. Then place in a bowl of distilled water and vinegar for 30 mins each night. 

Can somebody tell me if this is right or wrong, if they have any recommendations or advice, or if anyone would like to educate me on what they have learned or has worked for them? I just want to keep my sister out of the hospital so she can stay home. 

I also would love any research articles to support cleaning a certain way as I love having evidence to support what I’m doing.

Advice Needed: Enhancing Job Prospects in Programming While Pursuing BTech in CS,Suffered_Heart,1,compsci,0,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I’d love to hear about them.

(Spoilers Extended) What importance could the Darkstar plot line have to the broader story?,Creative_Quality6972,1,asoiaf,0,"Putting aside all the easy jokes about our favorite edgelord, I’m genuinely asking if anyone can imagine if there’s a direction this “hunting Darkstar” plot line can go in that wouldn’t feel like a total sideshow. I’m not critiquing George’s writing necessarily. Maybe he has a vague plan here. It’s just the only major storyline where I’ve got almost no inkling of what could happen or why it would matter.

Yes, AFFC and ADWD are meandering travelogues, but most of the plot lines GRRM added in those books clearly will have some long term significance in the endgame(Euron becoming king, Arianne’s strained relationship with her father and her imaginary rivalry with her brother leading to the second dance of dragons with Dany, Faegon becoming king, etc.). But I struggle to imagine how Balon Swann, Areo Hotah, and Obara Sand hunting Darkstar could possibly go anywhere significant. It’s three characters about whom we know little hunting a character about whom we know nothing(beyond that he’s of the night, of course). Of all the hooks leading into TWOW, this one puzzles the most. Davos being sent to retrieve Rickon? I can easily imagine how that story tributary will feed back into the larger river. But this Darkstar stuff feels like it’s a guttering stream leading into the barren Dornish desert.

Before anyone says it, yes, I understand that House Dayne was probably meant to be more important before the five year gap was abandoned, and that some of the awkwardness here reflects George repurposing his original ideas. I’ve heard some others seriously suggest that the plot line should simply end unceremoniously in Areo and Obara dying so George can cut down on characters, which is absurd. The story does ultimately need to be streamlined, but GRRM isn’t going to break fundamental laws of storytelling to get there. Time has been spent setting up this plot line so it has to go somewhere. 

Where though? Dawn will more than likely come into the picture, of course. Will we learn more about the Daynes? Is it possible Darkstar might be aware of R+L=J(extremely unlikely). Where do people think this is going and how will it tie into the larger stories playing out in Westeros right now?",05-04-2024

What’s the point of validating a victim if they’re misbehaving?,North-Syrup-2041,1,self,0,"I’ve been hearing a lot of people talking about validation in regards to mental health & overall feeling safe when discussing difficult topics without being judged. I beg to differ.

It’s important for the person to be heard, yes, but as with everything else in life, there are limits. Can you really validate a person when they’re not acting reasonable? Can you really validate a person when they‘re mistake prone? Can you really validate a person when everything they say is wrong or worse, lies? Can you really validate a person when they refuse to acknowledge their own wrongdoing? Can you really validate a person if they’re going to misbehave? Can you validate a person when they’re not doing things the way it should be?

I say all this as a mother whose daughter went through a decade of childhood rape & while I’m proud of her for staying strong & composed in therapy & beyond, the way she acts now made her look like a child. You might say it’s from the repercussions from the rape & while it’s true, I can’t ignore her current behavior. One time, she blurted out that her father‘s a rapist (luckily he wasn’t). That isn’t venting. It’s saying things that aren’t true. She knows he isn’t & yet said it. I stepped in & told her to not say things like that again. What’s bad about her is she takes things the wrong way. She’s 27 & has every right to say & feel however she wants, yes, but someone needs to set her straight when she’s out to lunch. It isn’t venting. It’s being unreasonable. She’s also mistake prone & I had to correct her & when I do, she gets upset & defensive. There’s no nice way to go around it.

What I’m saying is while it’s important for a victim of trauma to be heard, there should be a cut off line to where we can’t validate them if they get destructive. When we validate them, it makes the victim think they get a free pass to do anything they want without knowing that their actions & trauma are hurting others. Do we really want that? When we validate them, it makes the victim think the world owes them & we have to cater our lives around them. Do we really want that? If we validate them, it makes the victim think that we’re okay with them ranting, pissing, destroying, verbally assaulting, etc. Do we really want that? Back to my daughter, I told her I felt like I had a naughty child. Trauma shouldn’t be at the forefront when confronting their behavior. There should be reason & logic. I validate her & her pain, yes, but cannot validate if she’s rebelling. Nobody should. You don’t validate a victim & just accept their word. You validate & either give advice or correct them.",05-04-2024

How to tell mom that she's the impractical one? Should I even tell her?,Plus_Marzipan9105,1,family,1,"I'm 30f. 

My mom said 'its difficult to be practical in this house'. She's complaining about how impractical we all are. But I find *her* to be the most impractical person in the house. 

The reason she called us impractical, is because she wants to wash clothes at night, and wants people to help her.... at 10 pm.... to hang clothes..... I told her the more 'practical' option is to wash it in the morning, and let my bro (who works afternoon shifts) to take it out.... The only reason why its more 'practical' is cuz my bro wakes up late, and it will be in the machine for a long time....... Obviously the practical solution is for my brother to his ass up at 9 - 10 am.

She scolds us for trying new things (even now at nearly 30), even tho she keeps comparing us to cousins who got all the 'good characteristics' she wanted (like outgoing, family orientedness, good fashion sense, ambition etc) by trying new things. I've asked my cousins what's their secret (they said 'just try'), and explained as much to my mom, but i don't think she gets it. 

She scolds me into buying clothes that she wants, that I don't want or need. She then scolds me for not wearing them. I now give everything back to her.

I'm trying to move out, and she's scolding me into living nearer to home, even tho its further from all the workplaces in town. I keep telling her that my place (A) is more practical than her place (B). A is 30 minutes from home and 45 minutes from work. B is 20 mins away from home, but 1.5 hours away from work. I've tried explaining to her without being rude, telling her '10 minutes isn't much difference', she just stays silent, so I have no idea why she's angry. I'm very tempted to print out google maps directions and frame it in the house. 

She scolds me for expressing disagreement or emotions, even tho she vents to us, scolds us for no reason etc. This is probably just my opinion, but expressing disagreement is just practical communication.

She wants to cook at home and therefore scolds us for eating dinner at home. We all had pre-arranged plans and have told her we'll take the leftovers to work tomorrow, and she scolds us! I've tried getting her to explain herself, she has no answer. She knows we're not wasting anything, or doing anything wrong. But she still gets pissed.

She's not practical! AND she's a hypocrite. I really want to tell her to look in the damn mirror. But how do I tell her nicely that she needs to cool it?",05-04-2024

Shaving does help make you feel better! ,ahmoudyy,1,wicked_edge,0,"I’ve had a terrible week losing a longtime friend in a car accident at the age of 31 leaving behind a 2 years old daughter and lost a cousin who left behind 3 little girls in the surgery room on the very same day then having some of the toughest time at work. It was horrid. I resorted to silence dealing with all of this as I wasn’t able to comprehend everything all at once. 

This morning (7:28AM Cairo time ATM) I had a very slow shave with Le Pere Lucien cedar and patchouli, my good old Mühle R89 (how I started wet shaving) and a fresh Feather blade (always a use once and toss with Feather for me). 

I took my time, listening to audio news and things of interest for me. Obviously had a world class shave, but the most important part is that I felt better! I’m headed to work today and I feel significantly better, i feel like I can maybe start over again! 

If anyone tells you it is a ridiculous hobby or that it’s not worth the money tell them to fuck right off because it’s cheaper than the therapist.

Reintroducing Chuck Mosley - Life On the Road and its songs,proshortcut,1,FaithNoMore,0,"A friend of Chuck Moslet who did the congas durinf the last couple years, Douglas Esper, wrote a book about his days on the road with Chuck. It was a fine, even if maybe not as enthralling as hoped, read about going around the country and UK on the semi-acoustical tour right right up to the overdose.


I started looking up song titles from the book on YouTube. Relocation is an amazing, passionate, and gut wrenching song. Does a studio version of this song exist anywhere other than live videos?


I also discovered Primitive Race's Cranial Matter from the book. Not FNM, but the guy still had it. RIP.

"I now drink ""with"" myself instead of ""by"" myself ",gladefarer,1,mentalhealth,0,"Ever have friends over for a catch up & a drink & eventually find yourself sitting finishing off your bottle in an empty house at the end of the night?

Ever visit friends & stay your post on the couch once they've gone to bed?

I do. A lot. I typically have good ""session stamina"". I tend to cradle a comfortable state of 'fuckedupness' & ride that the wave until such times as I'm alone then vibe by myself.

But yo, that's okay in principle! Though, what hasn't been okay is my habbit of using that time to ruminate & ultimately self depricate.

Lately, I've noticed that I'm getting so much better at enjoying my solo drunkness/being high that it kinda feels like a bit of a Dark Souls bonfire. A familiar place that's now used to reflect, process & digest in a healthy way.

And y'know, it's now a pretty big deal whenever I slip up & end up upset, using isolated continuation of my festivities to hurt myself. That shit sucks. Who wants that?

Trying to remember a book I read when I was a kid,abundanceangel,1,suggestmeabook,0,"When I was in elementary school there was this book series that me and my sister read that I've been looking for for years. It's a sci-fi or fantasy, probably middle grade and it was a mix between a graphic novel and a chapter book. Lots of pictures, but actual paragraphs telling the story.

I remember it being about two kids who traveled to different climates/worlds and faced off against I think ogres or trolls and came back. I remember one of the books was called Into the Tundra or something like that and that it had a lot of green. I think they went into the portals through a magic forest or something. One of the kids was black. I thought it was a girl as a kid, but I'm not sure. They had brown locs that covered the majority of their face. The other was a ginger white boy. This has been driving me crazy for years. I think it wasn't a well known book which is why it's so damn hard to find, but if anybody knows what I'm talking about please tell me the title.",05-04-2024
Struggling with boyfriends 2yo daughter. Will she grow out of this wishy-washy relationship?,Madam-struggle,1,AskParents,0,"TLDR- Despite my best efforts, my boyfriends 2yo daughter loves me sometimes and doesn't like me others. It's entirely random. Is that just age appropriate or is there something I could/should do differently? Will this change with time? Should I take a step back and accept the relationship for what it is, or keep trying to build something closer and more positive? Pls help :/

My boyfriend and I have been together right at a year. He has 50/50 custody of his daughter who just turned two. I met her around christmas and things have been kinda up and down since the beginning. Historically I have been really good with kids, so the back and forth is pretty jarring for me. I know she is just two and things are probably really confusing for her, but I have genuinely never had this much trouble bonding with a child her age (or any age tbh, and I have worked with kids for years). 

I feel like I do all the obvious stuff. Take things at her pace, keep my distance from her dad when she is around, avoid any kind of discipline or correction, play with her but never force it, avoid any physical contact unless she initiates, ask her to do some of her favorite things like coloring/bubbles/etc. Sometimes she loves me and wants to play and give me hugs and wants me to carry her and asks me for help with things. Sometimes I can't even say hello to her without her glaring at me. It's not just that she likes me when she is in a good mood and doesn't like me when she is grumpy. She could be in the best mood ever but if I sit down in the chair next to hers she might pout and scoot away. She could be a grumpy little monster but something I do or say might pull her out of it. 

I just don't know what to do. Part of me feels like she is just a toddler, I am a new person and she will grow out of it eventually. Another part of me feels like it may never change because I haven't actually seen her be this way with anyone else. As a grown woman I feel crazy getting my feelings hurt by a literal child, but I love her so much already and I am so scared of having a bad relationship with her. My relationship with my stepmom has always been rough and I can't stand the thought of continuing that cycle. Do you guys have any thoughts? Any ideas on how to build more positive interactions? Do I just need to go to therapy about it to deal with my own feelings? Is there anything I could try?",05-04-2024
Admitting my feelings ,Fun_Professional_864,1,bisexual,1,"Tomorrow I am seeing my ex best friend. The friendship ended because, essentially, I was having a hard time coming to terms with my feelings for her and she said something slightly offensive that gave me a reason to cut her off.

I have been processing my feelings for a few months, and I think I’ve finally come to terms with my feelings for her. (I had irrational jealousy when she dated males or females, dreams of being with her, etc.) 

I asked her to talk tomorrow and I finally want to admit what I was feeling and how it resulted in our friendship ending the way it did.

I know she is bisexual and that doesn’t mean she had feelings for me at any point, but I think it is important for me to tell her why I quit things cold turkey, and how I have realized my mistakes.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? Is this a stupid idea? Am I insensitive for bringing this up now so late? I’m not sure if I should just hold this in and let it die, as I’ve never expressed my feelings for a girl before. 🥲

Numerology of Chucky,shaneka69,1,NumerologyPage,0,"&#x200B;

[Numerology of Chucky](https://preview.redd.it/tfx7ltkd5cyc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac10f6c2d482759a30beb5b199e703b362c7348)

Doing a Numerology analysis of Chucky for fun. 

CHUCKY=8 and 8 in Numerology is the number of Karma, but also it is the number of death when looking from an astrological point of view. Even though his full name is Charles Lee Ray, he loved to go by Chucky instead. 8 is the number of power, control, and death. Chucky was technically in control by possessing the doll. 8 is also connected to the taboo. He used voodoo to transfer his soul. 

Chucky has the personality #5 and 5 is connected to active killing and crime. ""Killer doll"" while the 8 represents the aftermath of killings which is death.

Notice how Chucky has that infamous laugh. Not only is the doll funny and adorable, but he is quite creative and loves to travel to get his goal met. Chucky's soul urge is 3. 3 is connected to creativity and optimism. It's also the number connected to being child-like,talkative or chatty.

Now let's look into Charles Lee Ray because he was a killer in human form.

Charles Lee Ray was a person who could have actually been quite charming with his personality number being 7. He could have lured people and easily put them under his authority. He had an 8 soul urge which is similar to having a Scorpio moon. This can darken one's thoughts, especially with the energy of strategic number 7 being his personality number. This gave him the skill and study to master his art of killing until he couldn't anymore. He got killed which could be due to his overall destiny number being 6 which shortens the life span/journey (in his case). This 6 also added to his charm and how soft he came off, but that didn't stop him from committing the murders.

Visiting Mt Fuji - Advice,NorthAd2282,1,JapanTravelTips,1,"So I'll be in Tokyo from the 30th of June to the 4th of July, I'm hoping to do a day trip to Mt Fuji on one of those days.

Is it even possible to help me?,goofy-looking-ahh,1,Healthygamergg,1,"I am a 24 year old male who should be in the time of his life but honestly im feeling like im already dead and lived the ""best"" part of my life. Everything sucks, i hate myself, i hate my life.

Im jobless, never had real irl friends, i suffer frm social anxiety which makes me absolutely awkward, even i feel myself being awkward, when i try to avoid any basic interactions. I isolated myself so much over the past years, i feel too incompetent to socialize and i also hate to socialize. I want to date girls and get a relationship, but i also wanna keep me safe so i dont get personally hurt anymore. I've been through some shit, my trust got abused and stomped on, treated like shi on the sidewalk etc. And how should i care and provide a good relationship if i dont even care about me and my life?
And nobody seems to care about me. Im alone, depressed, i dnt care much about other ppl and their problems even tho i really like them and having them around me. I feel so cold hearted and not empathetic, i actually dont think ppl actually like me even tho they say it. And those ppl are just ppl i met online. Irl they wouldn't even be there anymore because i would treat them also like shit, unintentionally, but like shit.
I know i need help, but i cant be bothered to get my ass up and go to a doctor and tell him. Im afraid and i lowkey dont care.
I gave myself up and accepted that im living a real miserable life rn.
Like I lost motivation and fun in everything i did. I waste my time by consuming videos on YouTube just to make the time run faster. If there is anything challenging i dip out and throw it away, even if its a thing i actually like to do. Im always looking for the easy way. Idk why, did i got too lazy or do i just not care enough to actually sit down and learn the stuff? Im the most boring person i know because there is nothing going on in my life.
Im throwing my lifetime away like if its nothing and my body became a ""lifeless"" shell. I feel dead inside and there is actually no reason i wake up beside my body telling me i got enough sleep. 

I dont see any light at that tunnel. I know i need help, i know it, i reflected so much on me and my life decisions, that i hate me the most. But why cant I be bothered going there? Why is it so hard even tho i know it would probably help? Why cant i see myself worthy enough to do?
Is it even possible to help someone like me?

I needed to get it out somewhere. If my grammar is bad im sry, english isn't my firts language.

AE Arcade Daily Max,-CloudZenn,1,AtlasEarthOfficial,0,"I've spent a lot of time playing the arcade games and ive come to the conclusion that this isn't just a coincidence anymore. After I spend a few hours on one or many of the games it stops giving you rewards for awhile. There is some daily max or max within a certain timeframe. I have this happen pretty much daily now. I feel we should be made aware of the max so we dont waste our time. There should be a progress bar or something indicating the progress towards that max. Also (as others have suggested), putting a individual progress bar on each offer so we know if the ""time played"" is even going up and something equivalent for the task offers.

Advice Needed: Enhancing Job Prospects in Programming While Pursuing BTech in CS,Suffered_Heart,1,EngineeringStudents,0,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and/or Backend programming. But I could also learn full stack. Till now I’ve used Python at intermediate levels and C++ at beginner levels. I’ve also done some projects on Bash scripting for Raspberry Pi projects. 

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I’d love to hear about them.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and insights!

PS : I’m in India but down to go aboard on my own expense if I get confirmation of employment. 

**TL;DR:** Pursuing BTech in CS, seeking advice on boosting job prospects in programming. Interested in which events and competitions to join, effective networking strategies, the benefits of LeetCode for coding practice, and which certifications and skills are most valuable. Open to opportunities abroad with confirmed employment. Appreciate any insights on internships and extracurricular activities. Thanks!

I think my boss hates me. ,Shortstack169,1,work,0,"So, I recently moved and got a new job. Due to my past experiences I moved up fairly quickly, and I'm even in training to be a lead in my department. The current lead was nice when she was training me, and I thought we were cool. I mean we talked and had each others number. Talked about our personal lives (Which is something I never do at work) and now that I'm fully trained, she hardly talks to me. There is another girl in our department that has been working there longer than me, and they were friends before I started working there but I feel as if she lets their friendship get in the way of their work life. For example, all week this week i was assigned to do 4 times the work that either one of them has been. Every single day. And I have just felt like crap, due to pollen and my horrible immune system. People have noticed that they stay together and have even commented on how they seem like their hips are stuck together. Then Thursday I told someone what all i was doing because he asked. He helps me sometimes when he has a chance because he is also trained in our department but has moved up, and when I told him, he went and told the boss. The boss  then goes to me lead and asks why i have all that work.  She comes to me all mad saying that 'multiple people told me I was freaking out.'  I told her that I wasn't freaking out, I was just tired, and I felt horrible. She said well 'i don't know, people are stupid' and walked off. I went to talk to her about an hour after that at her desk and she didn't even acknowledge by presents. Acted like I wasn't even there.  Her friend came up and I asked her a question and she acted like she didn't hear me and immediately started a conversation with my lead, in which she replies to her. A little after that the boss that's over me and her came to me and said if i don't feel good, to just go home. I was a little pissed because I have been sick all week, and doing this and I said one thing to one person, and it gets blown out of proportion.   I feel stuck because I literally haven't done a single thing to her, I hate drama and it gives me literal anxiety that I called out today just because I didn't want to face her. I don't know what exactly to do or who to even talk to without sounding like a whinny teenager. some advice and help would be greatly appreciated. ",05-04-2024

She transferred me to a different therapist because of my progress, but that fell through because my parents were able to find a different office where I could get my meds and not have to do the therapy.

"Had an ""aha"" moment learning Billy Strings bluegrass style song",labMC,1,Guitar,0,"After a period of feeling like I hit a learning plateau, I decided to try and learn this bluegrass style  song by Billy Strings. Did the same thing 12 years ago where I pivoted to learning classical guitar for almost a year and I feel like learning another style took me out of a rut and helped me to become more confident fingerpicking.

Hoped to find the same with bluegrass when I stumbled upon the video of Billy Strings playing the 1935 Martin D-18 and [this amazing video by Marcel on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SByKUPY8IQE&t=87s). Similar to when I learned classical guitar, when learning this song I feel like I had an ""aha"" moment of something so easy, so simple, but it messed with my brain and deep guitar habits. Wanted to share because it was so interesting to me.

I started playing [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SByKUPY8IQE&t=87s) by ear and briefly looking at the tab, not really looking at the notes too much, and it sounded OK but something was off. It did not sound right, not the same ""feel"" from the section I got from Billy on the video.

When I slowed down to listen and looked at the individual notes on Marcel's video, I realized and had an ""aha"" moment: Some of the bass notes he plays were on the ""and"" part of the measure and my brain wanted to play on the 1, 2, 3, or 4. Took me a little bit for my brain to get used to playing it the right way, which was strange but awesome.

Imagine a metronome, where beat is the quarter notes 1, 2, 3, 4. Eight notes are the ""and"" in between.

One 4/4 measure count: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

My brain was habitually wanting to play on the quarter note like this:

https://preview.redd.it/1hmjrd5i6cyc1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=089d45c607e0250bb86cf6690278e0618821765d

But the way it is actually played is on the ""and"" like this section for example:

https://preview.redd.it/pjqi8dmg6cyc1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=18afb657747307b8221f6177b4e1b19e15c99ed4

I don't know if anyone else will understand so I had to write this up. So strange that something so simple could give me any trouble at all but I ended up spending good amount of time practicing to get it right!

Shifting one note just an eighth note over makes such a huge difference in the sound. Fascinating to me that such a small thing can make such a big difference.

Give it a try! The section I'm referring to in the above table is the Am section of the song but there is another part with the Cadd9 where the bass note is on the ""and"" which makes big difference there as well.",05-04-2024

4 May 2024: Is hang Seng tech index rebound for real?,YOLOTREND,1,great_investment,0,"This is really a tough call. Since the peak in Jan/Feb 2024 when hang Seng tech index hit around 11,000, the downtrend then continues for over 3 years. It tested 2700 points in 2022 and rebounded back to around 4800 before coming down and tested around 3,000 points in Jan/Feb 2024.

The truth is china economy has not fully recovered yet, with its property sector facing stress, its youth unemployment being relatively high, business sentiment and willingness to invest in big capex and r&d, etc are all weak.

There was supposedly to be big political meeting in late 2023 but it was delayed. The current indication is to have the big political meeting in July 2024 now and it is important that the focus is to get the economy back to shape.

All in all, it is tough to make a higher odds bet. It is more important to focus on companies consistently creating value for their shareholders. Good companies with strong business model, adaptable culture, good product roadmap and range would help a company's long term value.

We lived in the lower apartment at the time. Our friends that are like family asked us if we would help them by going in together to bye a home. We knew how hard things had gotten  for them so we agreed. We spent lots of time talking about  it and everyone agreed that if we got the house all the bills would be split evenly. We found a home we all liked and applied for a home loan. My husband's and my credit scores were higher so the loan was approved in our names. Now there are 6 people living here and 5 of them get paid weekly or biweekly. Except for me. I get a disability check once a month and it's not a lot. Somehow 4 of them decided I should  pay all the utilities myself. My husband and I decided before we  moved I would pay our part of the house payment and he would pay the other big bills. So, I've been paying all of it for over a year which basically leaves me with nothing left. When I've asked them what happened to the agreement of splitting all the bills, they get mad and offended and refuse to help me.

Quran and Historical Context,AbuIbrahimAlAmriki,1,Quraniyoon,0,"How much of a role does historical context play into understanding the Quran? This seems to be one of the main factors dividing hard line 'Quran-only' and 'Quran-centric' thinking. One side more or less rejects any historical data (to a point) to support their Quranic interpretations while the other will accept historical data that does not contradict the Quran. 

I think this is a crucial impasse for our community. We all agree on the Quran and it touches the hearts of the faithful, yet we are divided in our interpretation of history. I think we need to have a more coherent discussion about the context of the Quran, its also a developing field in academia, with the discovery of new epigraphy and the academic interest in early islamic history. Its an exciting time. May God guide us all, I'd be interested to hear everyones thoughts about the relevance of history to contextualize the Quran. 

This is an excerpt form a Fazlur Rahman Malik book I'm reading which sort of sparked my thoughts about the topic: 

*It goes without saying that the Qur'an was taught as the nucleus of the new Teaching. But the Qur'an is obviously not intelligible purely by itself-strictly situational as its revelations are. It would be utterly irrational to suppose that the Qur'an was taught without involving in fact the activity of the Prophet as the central background activity which included policy, commands, decisions, etc. Nothing can give coherence to the Qur'iinic teaching except the actual life of the Prophet and the milieu in which he moved, and it would be a great childishness of the twentieth century to suppose that people immediately around the Prophet distinguished so radica.lly between the Qur'an and its exemplification in the Prophet that they retained the one but ignored the other, i.e., saw the one as divorced from the other. Did they never ask themselves the question-even implicitly-""why did God choose this person as the vehicle of His Message ?"" Completely non·sensical is that view of modern scholarship which, gained no doubt from later Muslim theological discussions themselves, makes the Prophet almost like a record in relation to Divine Revelation. Quite a different  picture emerges from the Qur'an itself which assigns a unique status to the Prophet whom it charges with a ""heavy responsibility"" 12 and whom it invariably re- presents as being excessively conscious of this responsibility. 13*

Not just that but the pilot light that this set has also doesn't exist on the schematic or the radio from factory! The radio refuses to operation without the resistor so I'm stuck until I solve this.

"Tokyo 7-8 days trip, 3 adults 2 teenagers",patrickkteng,1,JapanTravel,1,"Hi, first time traveling to Japan here, and is rather overwhelmed with all the information gathered so far.

We are traveling in a total of 5 pax (my mom, my siblings (2 of them at 15 years old), me and my wife) and I am in charge of the itinerary, mainly oriented towards kids & fun/cute stuffs (my wife love cute stuffs like sanrio and disney stuffs).

We have not decided the total days yet (very pre-stage in planning). But our estimate is around 8-10 days (max). And I take into consideration that 2 days will be wasted due to flights usually (first and last day).

Currently, our itinerary (by day, but not in order yet) is something like this

* 1 Day
   * Disneyland + Parade (not available on Friday AFAIK?)
* 1 Day
   * Disneysea (although no parade, I assume this will take the whole day as well)
* 1 Day
   * Akihabara (Anime land)
   * Kanda Yabu Soba (famous soba place)
   * Jyotou Curry (same as Joto Curry shibuya)
   * Ueno
   * Cafe Capyba
   * Senso-ji
   * Tokyo Skytree (should we go at night?)
* 1 Day
   * Shibuya Area
   * Shibuya Sky
   * Joto Curry (famous katsu place)
   * Yoyogi Park
   * Meiji Jingu (if no foliage, we going here instead of yoyogi park)
   * Shibuya Scramble Crossing
   * One Piece Straw Hat Store (inside MAGNET by SHIBUYA109)
   * Shibuya Parco (Pokemon Centre, Nintendo..)
* 1 Day
   * Ginza area
   * Tsukiji Market (Expensive seafood market)
   * Uniqlo Ginza
   * Sanrio World Ginza
   * Kaitenzushi Nemuro Sushi rotary place
* 1 Day
   * Teamlab Borderless (seems like nothing nearby this place?)
   * Tokyo Tower (not sure if it's a nice place for kids to see)
   * Tokyo Midtown (not sure if it's a nice place for kids to see)
   * anything we can fit here?

Wagyu Places - Yakisoba CELONA, Ginza Steak (Buffet) \[Any other recommendations? Not too costly as we're on a budget\]

Anything else that we should go/can fit in/should not go based on the itinerary above? Should we go Disneyland & Disneysea back to back, or should we put a gap in between to rest our legs or something?

I'm still trying to maybe fit in 1 more day, or if that's really it, then maybe I just make it a 7 days trip instead.

Any AirB&B/Hotels recommended near Tokyo area? We need either 2 rooms or 3 beds, hoping its around <$200/night total.

Thanks",05-04-2024
I don’t believe you.,Jaysownay,1,Silksong,0,"To all people saying you just want a little bit of communication, even just “we’re still working on the game”: I don’t believe you. 

You really think that would have been better than radio silence? You really don’t think it would just be a monthly “🤡We’re🦀still💅working🗿on📸it🤡” anti-sanity fest?

The only thing I can imagine being EVEN PARTIALLY satisfying to this community would be actual game content or development details (eg. edge magazine article). Short of that, any communication from team cherry would be met with the same clownery and insanity that we’ve been experiencing for the last 3-4 years.

Given that team cherry clearly isn’t going to release any more game or development details, I honestly think the radio silence and occasional ‘relax everybody’ from leth is about as good as we could ask for.

I don’t mind the insanity, I’ve been waiting since the kickstarter and I‘ve been here through every bizarre r/silksong meta (-Y). I support every silkpost, complaint rant, and unhinged conspiracy, but acting like team cherry is doing something wrong by not communicating with the community is pretty cringe.",05-04-2024
Can we give praise for the fact we have got a bountiful harvest? ,houseofball00ns,5,KendrickLamar,0,In all my years. I have not been this excited about two artists going at it. Regardless of what's rumor or provable. These are some of the most craziest bars I've heard in history. ,05-04-2024
On the topic of vore writing…,tefifonconnoisseur,1,sfwVore,0,"So since I’m not exactly the greatest artist, I picked up writing in order to create content and not be such a lurker. I was wondering how many others in this server actually write vore stuff? I know that sfw writers aren’t exactly in high supply, but I just feel alone sometimes whenever I post my work here since nobody else seems to write on here.
Now, so we’re clear here, the issue isn’t and has never been the level of attention I receive. I don’t post here for attention; I do that on Wattpad. Frankly, I post what I want to see for the most part and if people like it, awesome. Yes, I want attention on Wattpad, but it really doesn’t bother me if they don’t. I have more important things to worry about. My issue is that I’m potentially the only writer here. I know it’s stupid, but it makes me feel like I’m posting memes in the business group chat; just kind of out of place lol.
I am, however, working on my art skills, so maybe at some point I’ll post art here too. Until then, I will share links to my stories here. If you want to read them, cool. But if I’m the only writer here, once my art skills are bearable enough for me to share, I’ll stop sharing stories here, because I’m not wishing to be the odd one out. I deeply apologize if I’m coming off as rude at all, that wasn’t my intention.",05-04-2024

Support ArrowHead and don't blame them,KarEssMoua,0,Helldivers,0,"I have been watching the storm the whole day, and sadly, the review bombing.

While as I share the angriness living in you for the PSN account on steam, please do remember that ArrowHead must bow in front of Sony, for now. I call for any Helldivers, not to blame the devs, but Sony for their greed of data. We all know, deep inside us, that Arrowhead was not planning to do this. We had faith in this game and this studio, and they showed us multiple times that we could trust them.

Now, sadly, the video game industry is lead by greedy companies, and it is important to punish Sony and not ArrowHead. Boycotting Sony is a way to do that. Petitions are another way to do it. If you want to express your frustration, do it on Sony's social media and not ArrowHead.

WE KNOW they are all nerds like us. They are an independant studio. And as many indepedant studio, they are taking risks to deliver us something different from the triple A. Unfortunately, Sony is the publisher of Helldivers 2. Though, you have a right and a voice to show your support to ArrowHead while disclaiming this outrageous act of Sony, leading to refund we aren't sure to get and would be unfair to ArrowHead. 

All of us have enough of company greeds. Helldivers already showed its strength and how a small studio can shake the video game industry. Let's support those studios by spreading the words of the big companies greed. Small studios are trying to release something made by players, for players. We are their voices. This game has shown how a game can rally foreign people from different countries towards a common goal. And here, it's the same, but IRL. Let's support our managed Democracy.

There is a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/prevent-mandatory-psn-account-requirement-for-helldivers-2-on-steam?recruiter=1337734252&recruited_by_id=d1617990-0973-11ef-84f7-b38e8c4dd152&utm_source=share_petition&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_medium=copylink&utm_content=cl_sharecopy_490041685_en-GB%3Acv_1105673) you can sign for, to mobilize our ranks and prove that the gaming community has enough of this, and we want the video game industry to stay the 7th art it used to be.

The end of money,ConcordeSpeedKing,1,LibraryofBabel,0,"What was the point of the banking and finance system, from the point of view of control

There was ample capacity to domineer in the old world

Plenty of ultra-violence and famine and pestilence

The evil hungry gods had their fill always

So why these twists and turns in the saga

I don't know so I'll write about it

\~\~

It is not nearly enough to feed me long term to have a bunch of sweating heaving victims suffering in the asylum

No

I want to rot their brains entirely

They can't have any independence

It is a long march

No. 1 they cannot satisfy their daily living necessities anymore without going through me and my squad down below

No trading one's goats for chickens

There will be an economy

And in the long term they will trade my printed dimes for dice and roller skates and superfluous trinkets

The daily essentials will be a poisonous destructive alternative to what they cherish -- again all mine

And by 1964 that should be fine and dandy

By 2018 I'll have them signed onto a virtual loony bin alternative

And from there we'll get them stuck and broken on an infinite loop of mindlessness material

Until they don't care or try to exercise their mind's eye or inner what-have-you one bit

And that is actually a dry run for the main thing

Which will be the final replacement of their fight or flight instinct with a kind of don't-give-a-fuck comatose acceptance of whatever is in their field of vision

Imagine being presented with *any* material, no matter how repulsive, with zero physiological reaction

Just grape juice squeezed out for my fermentation device at that point

I am confusion lovely trans people please explain xD ,NoExcitement3588,1,asktransgender,1,"So growing up I always wanted to be one of the boys and hang out with my brothers but no surprise got rejected. Also classically whenever I did have a guy friend he would make it weird eventually saying he had a crush on me ew bruva ew I played bey blade with you wdym you dont see me as a person xD

More trans evidence for your highnesses:

When I first started talking I used male only pronouns to refer to my self (everyone just assumed I spent too much time with my dad)

Puberty was an embarrassing horrific event I was upset I didn't grow a dick instead of boobs xD jealous of all my friends crackling voices , rat staches  and the amount of muscle they packed on doin nothin!? 

It was a tragedy to me when I discovered I could no longer swim shirtless, often times very envious of men and how free they can be, and how my body hair is apparently dirty but they're leg hair can fly in the wind no problem xD

  
When I was 10 I would fall asleep crying wishing I would wake up a boy.

My aunties had to literally hold me down to put a dress on me and the last time I wore one was when I was 11 to Prom xD 

Wearing my first pair of boxers was gender euphoric as well as my first suit.

  
Now for the anti evidence xD

I don't give a fuck anymore I think my body's ait, I don't mind it, now that I've rid my self of the internal misogyny I've come to appreciate it even. We love women around here xD but yknow I feel pretty neutral about it I like wearing masc fits but I never feel like I ate in any outfit and idk if that's because I need to workout more or if its the gender thing xD 

  
I used to be really put off by anything feminine but now I'm willing to try things just for fun. It would be less confusing if I still didn't entertain anything like make up but I've changed xD Although if I were to manify XD I would not wear make up, like im just trying stuff for how I look and present now but my minimalist ass would be like no need Im big hairy man now xD

But I struggle being my self around anybody, I still have moments where I hate the way I look in general and don't want to go outside, should mention I have really quite bad social anxiety which I'm curious if it is related to my gender stuffs or if gender has nothing to do with all this??

  
Now when people refer to me as a man or cant tell my gender usually trying to be disrespectful I'm not exactly affirmed feeling.

  
I've come to find out my mums really chill with whatever decision I make on this gender stuffs xD yay for best mum but imagining her calling me by a new name and masculine pronouns sounds uncomfortable and like oh no am i wrong about this? or have I just grown really used to the pronouns I used before?

I don't want to be wrong about this xD I know little me would be hype as fuck to have a beard and a deep voice tho. 

Cause like when I was younger I would say I suffered from gender dysphoria for definite but now im very aloof about my body, I wear guy clothes and try to look ""pretty"" the most fem thing ive done this year is use lip plumping balm and mascara and I've considered buying thongs because I like minimalism and boxers take up half my drying rack xD

Im unemployed, have no friends, 21, safe to say I'm not living life to the fullest atm and have been in this sort of social anxiety hibernation for a couple months since I ran out of my last job due to social anxiety in October, I mean you could say ive been in hibernation since I left high school at 17 with short bursts of im gonna do something impulsive to feel alive for a couple months and then right back to my dark little room 

My first impulsion post covid was buying a 1 way ticket to to the NL to live with a man I met in a tiktok comment section a month after talking to him xD If I ever say im not impulsive im lying cause when I landed in the NL i was like oh fuck what have I done, I forgot the whole other language thing xD and then met him and the vibe was so off but i was like hey its for the plot imma aim for 6 months xD so I stayed with him in his room in the house in which we had like 10 other roommates for a month xD my first thoughts when I saw him were of fuck this man is in full control of my life right now unless I buy a return ticket xD but its for the plot I need to see what this life thing is about with the bonus of legal weed xD 

Thats just one example xD but yeah I do impulsive things then get stuck with the consequence's and then retreat back to my room in my mums house xD

  
I've been a stoner, chef, nightshift warehouse worker, lots of failed attempts at formal education. Idk who I am and what I actually want and if this stagnation in my life is caused by me pushing all my trans stuff in a box and burying it a couple years ago.

So am I trans? Ive been trying so hard to not be for years and now when I hear ""its okay if you are"" from the most important human in my life and I'm suddenly unsure, I don't hate my body anymore, i gym it and its fun to see the gains, I wouldint mind a mastectomy because I already wear sports bras 24/7 I never want to be caught without one in case I ever need to do parkour or smthn xD also would be very aerodynamic and my minimalist ass would enjoy having to organise less underwear's xD jokes aside a non butchered top surgery would be awesome and a gorgeous beard and luscious deep voice, hysterectomy too I would full send that hoe xD 

But the waiting times in the UK and the awkward in between stages of going through puberty as an adult and with peace and love looking a little goofy before the T really hits are scary as well as all the bureaucracy and how it may affect travelling for a while, there's a lot of hurdles in this journey so I need to know 100 percent that I'm doing the right thing for me. 

  
trans or naur? 

any comments will be much appreciated thank you!

and if you read all this. .  sorry XD I sincerely hope you have a lovely day and very comforting colourful dreams <3",05-04-2024

Broke toe from weights ,sassicassi06,1,EquinoxGyms,0,"A year and a half ago my toe got crushed at equinox. I was in a group fitness class and after everyone went to put their weights away in storage cubes. It’s a wall of storage cubes where the weights are stacked vertically and unsecured. These cubes go taller than I and I’m 5’7”. An unsecured weight from above my head ~15 lbs fell (possibly someone put it back unstable but either way it seems not secure and they’re tall) and a weight from above my head fell out of the cube and directly onto my toe. 

I was in immediate pain and couldn’t walk. I try my best to get out of my class and am in tears. The instructor is holding the door for people on the way out and I explain what just happened and that I needed a first aid kit as I could feel my sock soaked in blood. 

The teacher sits me down and leaves for ~15 mins while I sit in the gym in agony. They came back and there was no first aid kit available in the gym. They basically said bye and to file a report. 

I can’t walk as I’m in so much pain but manage to get to the locker room to grab my things and get an Uber home and file a report right away. 

My toe has gotten crushed from the weight and broke, I had to get my toe nail which was partially detached removed by a pediatrist, had to wear a boot for 2-3 months, and the most equinox did was freeze my membership for 3 months without penalty… 1.5 years later I’m still suffering damage from the injury.

Renewal Question - Help Center Ain't Helpful,nestledtogether,1,godaddy,0,"Hello, I am a couple months away from renewal with GoDaddy, but it is so unclear exactly what will be renewing and at what rate. Their pricing page is a mess, their chat is non-existent, and I can't find anything on their ""My Account"" pages. I'm only posting here because it's the middle of the night and if I can call anyone tomorrow, I want to have a better understanding before I get bamboozled into a costly annual subscription lol

So, I purchased my domain for the first time in November 2023 and got the products listed below:

* .COM Domain Registration - $11.99
* Full Domain Protection - $9.99
* Website + Marketing with Email - $13.90
* Websites and Marketing Starter - $(3.88) (Renews annually) 
* Microsoft 365 Email Essentials- $(10.02) (Renews annually)
* Fees - $0.18
* Total - $36.06

From what I am understanding, the .COM domain will renew at $21.99/year which sounds fine to me. The Full Domain Protection I may cancel.

The issue I am facing: I want to keep the email address I've created, but I don't care about the website or marketing services. I'm confused how I switch to just keeping the email address. If I look in my Admin portal, just the starter email is $4.33/mo ($51.90/yr). But then when I go to the Pricing page on their website, the price is $7.99/mo ($95.88/yr). Does anyone have any clarity on which pricing is actually charged?

Or, alternatively, keeping the Website + Marketing with Email bundle - does anyone know what the pricing on that is? Is that potentially more cost effective? I really don't have any marketing or website activity right now, so my main concern is keeping the business email cost effective. Thank you!",05-04-2024

Should my [34F] partner [32M] rehome his cats or put them through overseas flights and quarantine?,Pale_Tiger_2606,1,LongDistance,0,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I met online. He lives in the middle of Canada and I live in Sydney, Australia. We've been dating for a year (lived in each other's places for a while) and we recently decided that he would move to Sydney into my apartment. I own my place and I run a business so it would make more sense to do that than for me to move in with him. I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment with two cats (tabby and ragdoll, both rescues, male and female, about 2 and 3 years old). 

The issue is that he also has two cats (tabby and calico, both rescues, both female, both around 2 years old). If we bring them to Sydney, it would mean the cats would have to go through the following:
- 10 day minimum mandatory quarantine in a facility in Melbourne (we don't have access to the cats in that time)
- 5 flights total
- Approximately 25 hours of flying total, including a 15 hour flight across the Pacific
- 3 layovers, including 2 that are overnight boarding in Canada and New Zealand
- AUD$23,000 total

We both love our cats like they're our children and we were heartbroken when we saw how much they would have to go through just to come here. And after all that, we still don't know how well all four of our cats will get along, especially after his cats go through the trauma of the flights and layovers and worst of all the quarantine.

A bit more context: 
- My cats are fairly extroverted and social so hopefully they'd be okay with newcomers. My tabby has been looking for a rowdier playmate than my ragdoll, so this could be really good for him. They are both very settled and happy right now though. 
- His cats are a bit more introverted and take a while to get used to new people and places, but they've met foster kittens before and warmed up to them in a few days. 
- His tabby is extremely high energy at times and can be very stubborn when she doesn't get what she wants. When I lived at his place for a month, she woke us up quite a lot by knocking things over in the middle of the night due to frustration that her schedule changed and a new person was staying over.
- His cats are very bonded with him. His tabby is especially in touch with his every mood and twitch - their bond is stronger than any I've ever seen between a human and a cat.

We were hoping for advice about whether this move would be fair to put them through or not. The alternatives are that we end our relationship, or rehome his girls with a family member (his brother loves them and they love him), or rehome to a stranger. All are heartbreaking options for us and we were just wondering if cat experts might have some insight as to what would be better for the cats.

Thanks so much!

"SO,.....",Old-Suspect2923,1,IBDP,0,"Dear Student: The IB is aware of speculation that May 2024 exam content is being shared online. We understand this is a stressful time for you as a student and want to provide you with an update on the facts of the situation. Last week, we were alerted to activity online claiming that a small number of students have potentially engaged in cheating by sharing exam content on social media platforms. We took immediate action to investigate and address this activity which we discovered amounted to ""time zone cheating"". Time zone cheating occurs when students who have completed their examinations share what they can recall from memory about the exam questions on social media before other students take the examination. Time zone cheating is explicitly forbidden under our academic integrity policy. We know that the mathematics AA HL exam is a particular cause for concern. In this specific case, the students) have prepared a very professional looking document from memory including their thoughts on how to answer the questions. This was first published two to three hours ahead of when Western Europe students would be starting their examinations. We are carefully analysing all the comments and questions to identify any unusual approaches, which if repeated in an exam may be an indication that a student has seen or utilised this material. We remain confident that students in the U.S. and Canada remain unaffected by this issue. Therefore, it is vital that you do not seek, discuss or share the content or nature of any examination in the 24 hours before or after an exam paper is scheduled. This includes any online communication with other exam takers, including posts on social media platforms mentioning or discussing any aspect of the exam. Furthermore, we encourage anyone with information regarding these activities report them to us immediately to assist us in our ongoing investigations. It is important to report any concerns you may have about any possible academic misconduct, since failing to report a known case is also perceived as malpractice. Full information regarding academic honesty and penalties is available here. Thanks for your help in ensuring a fair and successful examination session for everyone, and we wish you the very best as you close out your school year.

Does one take notes when learning to code?,prettypositron,1,leetcode,0,"I mostly hear people say to ""just code"" but if you are a beginner, how do you begin to retain this stuff? 

So far, I've been doing the following:

2. Create ANKI cards for important concepts and exceptions I may forget in addition to proper syntax (and type it in)
3. Learning how to solve leetcode problems by reading the editorial or watching a video - this involves me hand-writing and drawing things, should I nix this? *Pictures of these notes are at the end of this post.*
4. Have a [custom ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-FKowQFKRU-coding-interview-coach) quiz me on stuff randomly

How do you remember all of the stuff in the documentation like the sort() method and the sorted() function and how the method requires dot notation with an empty argument. Should I just make an anki deck for these libraries?

"Sam's ""we aren't proud of being white"" comment regarding the group name WKUK..",r00stermane,1,WKUK,0,">  the Whitest Kids U’ Know, it’s a joke, we aren’t proud of being white, we’re pointing a finger at ourselves and saying “Look at these dorks over here! They’re so lame they called themselves dorks!”
> 


I'm proud to be a part of the WKUK fanbase, I can say that with certainty.

Seriously, proud of you all for being so dialed in on the censorship debate.

It's obviously an uncomfortable and shitty thing to have to discuss, especially regarding racial and sexual orientation type stuff.

But almost everyone, me included, seem to understand the nuance of the situation and respectfully disagree with it for the most part.

I gotta say, it makes me happy seeing the wisdom of this community revealed with the respectful pushback against censorship. I didn't expect that to be honest, especially on a website like reddit, however..

Sam's comment regarding the name of their **former** sketch group, WKUK, was unnecessary imo.

""it’s a joke, **we** aren’t proud of being white""

I'm emphasizing the ""we"" here and this is why: Trevor is gone.

Earlier I posted this


> These comments are soul crushingly real and I agree and I hate to say it but ""the whitest kids"" are no more.
> 
> The title is plural and it can never be changed. Sam literally shit on the name WKUK. ""it’s a joke, we aren’t proud of being white"" yeah thanks for spelling that out for us Sam, had to cover that base right?
> 
> WKUK sadly died with Trevor. He was clearly the main character and most creative/dynamic of the troupe I would say.


Sorry it's just disappointing is all. Having to cover that base for optics and/or personal belief(?)

My next thought was something like ""wait what exactly is Sam trying to say? Is it okay to be white? Am I a bad person? I wonder what Sam's response would be? And I **really** wonder where Trevor would stand on this whole mess.. is a piece of paper racist? Would Sam say the same thing if he was black and the name was BKUK? What would Sam's stripper name be if he was black? Dazzling Darkness? Or am I misinterpreting what he's saying?..""

I'm pretty baked rn so forgive me for rambling..

**Trevor himself** said this is where the name ""Whitest Kids U Know"" came from:

> **According to an IFC interview, Trevor Moore said the group's name originated during a freestyle rapping session on a subway when one of their friends said, ""You guys are the whitest kids I know"".**


That's it. It's a simple ""y'all white people crazy(usually meaning goofy)"" kind of thing like Tyler Perry would say. It need not be explained beyond that and i'm a little offended on Trevor's behalf, idk man it's hard to explain.

I'm just saying my only optimistic interpretation is something like this:

> It's not that we think us white dudes should inherently feel bad or shame/guilt for the color of our skin. We aren't *not* proud of being white. We aren't racist against anyone, white people included and we don't hate ourselves. I just have to make it clear that in order for us to be allowed to release our funny shit uncensored in 2024 we have to emphasize that we are ***not*** white supremacists.

I know i'm *way* overthinking this but it's only because the show & fanbase are invaluable to me. Y'all are like family. You ***get it***.

I hope this makes some sense. Again, high as fuck rn. Gonna go listen to Dinosaur Rap now in honor of Trevor Moore, RIP. Let me know what you all think.

PSA about Account linking... ,BaloothaBear85,1,Diablo,0,"Just wanted to let everyone know to just be careful when linking your Xbox/PSN etc... accounts with Bnet because if you screw up and link the wrong account or unlink your main account you will be locked out of the linking sysem for 365 days and there is nothing that Tech Support can do about it. 

My story, bought D4 on release (Xbox) and ended up playing some with my son on the split screen mode on the Series S. For some reason the Xbox conked out on me and has to send it for repairs under warranty but Microsoft just ends up replacing the whole thing. Got it back and reinstalled and started playing again with no issues until my son wanted to play the new season. 

When he logged in it gave him an error that the profile has been linked to another account and kicked him back to title. I investigated a bit until he lost interest and then that was it until we watched the new campfire chat and said he wanted to play again.

 Logged back in to his Bnet account to try to resolve the issue and his Bnet account was linked to my Xbox account (I have no clue how that happened) so I logged back out and into my Bnet account when a popup came up asking to confirm his bnet account to my Xbox account, I tried to cancel it but the cancel button appeared at the very bottom of the page with the miscellaneous legal links so you couldn't  click on the cancel button, in fact you couldn't hit the cancel button at all because they would select one of The Links at the bottom of the page. 

Unfortunately, I didn't make that connection I was trying to find a space that would let me cancel the linking and I did end up hitting the confirm button by accident. So now my son's BNET account is linked with my Microsoft account and my BNET account is now linked with his Microsoft account and after sending emails back and forth through tech support they pretty much told me there's nothing they can do once you link a profile it will lock you out for 1 year. So my only choices are to keep the swapped accounts or unlink them and wait a year to set them right that would also completely prevent me from playing the game that I purchased until that cool down has ended and I'm able to relink the accounts to the correct ones.

Because I want everyone to be able to play here is some information. You don’t have to be in a country to set up the PSN account,HolyArchitect,0,Helldivers,2,"Hello fellow divers!

The situation with the PlayStation network accounts is extremely frustrating. I know a lot of people are worried about being able to play the game specially those in countries that PlayStation does not support PlayStation work accounts. So I wanted to put out this information so that people can do so. 

1. Go to your preferred search engine and Google PlayStation network account sign up 

https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-network/

This is the link to the US one. If it gives you an issue, try just putting yourself in a private browser. However this link shouldn’t be necessary.

2. When you come to the page, go to create an account, it is going to then go to the seemingly blank page that also says create account( seems a little redundant but who am I to judge design I guess)

3. the following page will ask you what region you’re in. Select whatever region you want on that drop-down. Doesn’t matter if you live in that region/country. They don’t check.

4. go through the process of signing up with whatever email you want. If you don’t want them tracking your information, create a new one on Google or yahoo or whatever free email service that you prefer to use. Put in a fake name, put in a bunch of bullshit information if you want. Again they don’t check. They also do not require you to put in any payment information or sign up for any sort of live service subscription.

From this point it’s just basic set up of an account like with any service. Verify the email, etc. etc. 

The most important part about all of this, as it doesn’t require a VPN, it doesn’t require a DNS change, doesn’t require doing anything extra. So you don’t have to stress or worry about any of those things. The only real benefit of using your actual PlayStation network account is that it Imports your PlayStation network friends list.

Now I don’t want people to stop being angry about this. Make your voices heard. Show Sony what the power of managed democracy! now I don’t want people to stop being angry about this. Make your voices heard. Show them what managed democracy does bring that rage. bring that rage, use legitimate avenues to give arrowhead tangible evidence to show them that this implementation being forced upon players is Not the right way. I want everyone to understand, I do not believe arrowhead is the one pushing this. it’s obviously the people with the money that want to make money. And arrowhead has done such an incredible job in minimizing the monetization, Sony is trying to find other avenues to generate revenue and capitalize on our community.

So that is my guide to help. If I do anything ever in this community to make it a better place I hope this does.

Parent wanted me to say that sending his son to STAR Guides was a good idea,Changed0512,1,troubledteens,0,"I had a father reach out to me recently asking about STAR Guides, the first wilderness program I went to. I won't share details as to why or who it was, but he said his son wants the help and wants to go to STAR Guides. He asked about my experience, so I told him about my group members who engaged in relations when the staff knew and despite them both being told they'd go to jail if it happened again before they went to STAR Guides, both girls stayed until ""graduation"" because...money. I told him that he won't go back home after and instead a TBS, probably Oxbow Academy. I know a staff who works there and she was great at Horseshoe Mountain, but idk now that she's in with the TTI.

He then said that he doesn't feel like wilderness is a good idea for girls. Tf? First, what's the difference? Second, its bad for all genders, especially those who don't identify as female or male. He also said that he couldn't find any male reviews. I told him I know some guys and they hated it and anyone who said it helped them came to realize later that they were brainwashed. I even said that I was so brainwashed I begged my mom to go to RedCliff (long story). 

Anyways, it just seemed like when I didn't back up the idea that it was a good idea, he drifted. And I said that I'd be willing to help find outpatient programs. I don't know. Just a vent, ig. ",05-04-2024

Colonoscopy prep,mamajo692,1,colonoscopy,0,"So I am having a colonoscopy done next month and they want me to use this new prep called Suflave. They say it is less nauseating than the old liquid preps. I tried to have a colonoscopy done a little over a year ago. My first prep was the giant gallon jug ……puked…wouldn’t do the procedure. Next day second attempt, drank the little bottle of liquid that tastes like lemon lime soda….puked…violently…wouldn’t do the procedure. This time I asked for the tablets and they like talked me out of it and said that I should get this other medicine. I’m so afraid I’m gonna do all of this and I’m gonna puke and they’re not gonna do it anyway and it will have been for nothing. Has anybody ever used the Suflave before? What about the pills? If you used either one of them what was your experience with them? I have a prescription for both medications , I know my insurance won’t cover the pills but I would rather pay $150 and not throw up. 
I also take Ozempic and I’m so afraid of throwing up because with that, once you start you kind of can’t stop for a long time. Any help or advice is appreciated greatly. 
I should say it’s not just a colonoscopy that they are doing. I’m also having an endoscopy the same day. I’m wondering if they can do that if I throw up.",05-04-2024

My Manager was rude to me | invaded my privacy and said No for sick leave,AlmSrk,1,AusLegal,1,"I am working in a  renowned Retail shop in South Australia as a full time worker. Recently for a silly reason manager shouted on me and thrown her personal opinion on me which caused my mental breakdown. I called someone from higher position and complain about her. Next day she was furious and checked the surveillance camera tried to see what I did in my break time which I believe is totally invasion of my privacy because I was in staff common room during my break.

 on break I was late and she file something against me to break discipline rules which I agreed because I was really late. But she was explaining me that I was talking to 2 different persons over phone while I was in staff room she checked on camera. My question is can a manager check cameras when I am on my break in staff room and question me with whom I was talking? I believe it’s my privacy invasion.

after having discussion with her in 5 minutes I wasn’t feeling good and I asked her for sick leave and she refused in aggressive way. She was shivering she was angry why I am asking for sick leave just after having discussion. 


I needed to argue with her to get my sick leave and needed to explain my medical conditions which I believe is totally my personal issue. Moreover I feel like she doesn’t like me because I am the only girl who wear head scarves. I felt discriminated many times but I don’t any proof.

Now what type of legal action I can take against her for invading my privacy on workplace and tried to make me stay at work while I was not feeling well . ",05-04-2024

"GME Rips 30% Today, 15% Yesterday on No News - The OTC Derivatives Game is Afoot! 🚀🏴‍☠️ ",macems,2,Superstonk,1,"
Apes, listen up! Our beloved GME just ripped 30% today and 15% yesterday on absolutely no news. The FOMO is real, but there's more to this story than meets the eye. 

Through tracking the OTC derivative market member disclosures closely, it seems our old friend Citadel Securities is about to join the party. Starting this Monday, they're becoming a member of the OTC MPID directory for the NSCC, which gives them the ability to engage in equity swaps, futures, and other OTC derivative fuckery for stocks like our beloved GameStop.

Why would they do this, you ask? Well, the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) system is set to go live on 5/31, and it's expected to bring more transparency to the lit markets. Seems like Kenny & Co. are trying to move their shady exposure from the open (lit) markets over to the opaque OTC world as a last-ditch effort before the CAT starts watching their every move.

But wait, there's more! Rumors are swirling that Credit Suisse, one of the prime brokers caught with their pants down after the Archegos Capital blowup (where they inherited those pesky GME equity swap bags), is closing an account at the DTCC. And who's potentially picking up that bag? None other than the Swiss banking giants UBS. All eyes will be on their next few earnings reports to see if they've been handed the hot potato.

Now, here's the kicker: While the OTC markets are a black box, these derivative contracts still require the counterparties to deliver real shares (or cash equivalent) upon expiration or settlement. The larger their swap/futures positions, the more liquidity and shares they'll need to purchase on the open market to settle those contracts. This leads to high volatility on contract expiry dates (which may have been what we saw yesterday and today with increased volume). I fully expect FTDs to spike for these last two days when the report is published in a couple of weeks.

Guess what dries up the much-needed liquidity for the OTC counterparties (which leads to GME 🚀)? DIRECT. REGISTERED. SHARES. (DRS)

Every share we DRS and book removes yet another rock that these OTC snakes can hide under. It amplifies the FTD numbers and places increased pressure as they near settlement timelines, eventually forcing them to close out their opaque derivative exposure (by the T+35 exemption cycle for market makers).

So, keep locking up those shares, and get ready for the fireworks when these OTC derivative time bombs finally go off! MOASS is inevitable, and we're in the endgame now.

See you on the moon, you beautiful ape bastards! 🚀🌕

TL;DR: GME rips on no news. Citadel joining OTC derivative party to dodge CAT. Credit Suisse passing GME swap bag to UBS? DRS locks the float = No shares to settle OTC exposure = MOASS confirmed.",05-04-2024

Advice Needed: Enhancing Job Prospects in Programming While Pursuing BTech in CS,Suffered_Heart,1,techcareers,0,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and/or Backend programming. But I could also learn full stack. Till now I’ve used Python at intermediate levels and C++ at beginner levels. I’ve also done some projects on Bash scripting for Raspberry Pi projects. 

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I’d love to hear about them.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and insights!

PS : I’m in India but down to go aboard on my own expense if I get confirmation of employment. 

**TL;DR:** Pursuing BTech in CS, seeking advice on boosting job prospects in programming. Interested in which events and competitions to join, effective networking strategies, the benefits of LeetCode for coding practice, and which certifications and skills are most valuable.

Support     : $0.0(5)420 - $0.0(5)500  \*1st area trendline line

Resistance :  + $0.0(5)800 - ATH level.

conclusion : KENDU prove it's resilience when BTC drop below 57k range and now, BTC price $62k, ETH price $3.1k . SOL price $144.

Crypto market turn bullish again, atleast at the time i write this post.

let's hope the next week would be a good time for crypto rally to start or atleast calm down a bit. so memecoin season can have it's run.

  
What do you think ? let me know down on comment section ?

Landlord raising Rent (what else is new),fenrisiankings,1,alberta,0,"A friend of mine needs a place to stay and after discussing it with my landlord, I’m offering the second room in my basement suite. 

What I’m wondering is, can the Landlord raise rent based on two people living here?

I currently pay $1050 a month for a 2 bedroom basement suite and the landlord wants to raise it to $1350 a month based almost solely upon the fact that my buddy is moving in. I can understand raising rent in the current economy, it’s happening everywhere. But to raise it for a second person just seems like a money grab",05-04-2024

"2023 KIA Sportage LX, 4 Cylinder 2.5L",ValhallaGoblin,1,MechanicAdvice,1,"The details:

On February 21st, my partner drove to pick up food roughly 5 miles away from our house. When they started the car to come home it idled a little strangely, but was not immediately concerning so they figured we'd take a look at it once they got home. Roughly 500 feet later, at a red light, the engine died and wouldn't restart. It had to be pushed out of traffic and we had it towed to the nearest dealership the next day. The dealership decided it was the low pressure fuel pump and replaced it. We picked the car up and took it home on March 1st.

A month later, on March 31st, the issues returned. I started the car and was scraping ice off the windshield when the engine died. I got in, restarted it after a longer crank, it idled for roughly 10 seconds, then died. I started it again after another long crank, then pressed the gas a few times. The engine responded appropriately, so I let it idle and it died again after 5-10 seconds. KIA was called and a tow was sent out the next day. I was able to start the car and back it out of the driveway to line it up with the tow truck, then it died. I was able to restart it and get it onto the tow truck. Once it arrived at the dealership, it apparently had thrown no codes and was acting completely normal. The rep I spoke to said he had one of his techs drive the car for roughly 10 miles without any issues and it started right up every time they tried. We came and got the car again on April 15th.

Six days later, on April 21st, I went to start the car and it had a long crank. It did start, but again only idled for maybe 10 seconds before dying. This time my partner and I took multiple videos to prove that the car was, indeed, having issues. The car was towed again and is currently still at the dealership. Nothing much was able to be done because my partner and I were out of the country for a week, but we sent the videos to them today because, of course, the car was acting just fine for them. After watching the videos and asking some more questions, they decided to test the fuel. The fuel came back ""contaminated."" I asked what exactly that meant, but all I got was that it's ""bad gas."" They're going to put fresh gas and ""an additive"" into the tank and see if that fixes it.

My question is, does this sound like a contaminated fuel issue? I know only enough about cars to get me into trouble, really, so it sure doesn't sound like contaminated fuel to me. I could absolutely be wrong, though.

For someone who played the old halos and tried Infinite,StraightPotential342,1,haloinfinite,1,"As the title says for a person who played Halo CE to Halo Reach only. Steering clear from anything not made by Bungie. I finally broke my oath and played infinite multiplayer.

At the beginning I absolutely hated it. The way it's played, the weapons, the speed everything felt weird. I was about to uninstall then I said wait let me at least give it a shot. Gave it some time and started playing doubles just to practice.

Joined up with a guy and we played a bunch of games together and I started getting the hang of it and was having a hell of a good time. Really enjoying it once you get a feel for it.

Am I the Bad Apple for Not Wanting to Have a Joint Birthday Party?,Slytherin-Diasomnia,1,AmITheBadApple,1,"I (19F) am turning 20 at the end of May! 

My family was eating dinner tonight when my mom brought up the question of if I'd be okay with having a joint birthday party with my cousin, who we'll call Blake (9M), here in a few weeks. 

Here's the thing. Blake's turning 10. I will be turning 20. And I'm also kinda the black sheep of the family. Compared to my sisters and the rest of my cousins, who are sporty, extroverted, and loud, I'm nerdy, introverted, and quiet. I also have ADHD and tend to hyperfixate on interests easily and they can be one of my main go-tos of conversation, so when none of my cousins or my sisters know what I'm talking about, I don't really have much to say. 

Usually for family parties, my mom's side of the family (Grandparents, 4 siblings, and all their spouses and kids; 21 of us to be precise) will gather at my Nana's house and all hang out over food, and then we'll take a bit for cake, ice cream, and presents, and then do our own thing. But sometimes, if it's Blake's mom's kids' birthdays, we'll go over to their house for the party, and it'll be super jazzed up, considering the mom of the birthday kid is the host. There's a bit more attention to the birthday kid, which is fine. But the party's gonna be at Blake's mom's new house this year. 

I don't want to sound spoiled, but these twenty minutes each year are one of the only times I feel like I actually have people from my family paying attention to just me and celebrating me. I can't usually tell them the cool things that have been going on at college, because they won't really care about the fact that, for example, I got the last spot in Honor Choir, or that I got to go see a traveling Broadway production of Hadestown. Whenever I try to tell them these things I'm excited about, I kind of get brushed off. So I'm really looking forward to these brief moments each year when the attention's just on me and not one of my cousins who made the baseball team or my older sister who's the first grandchild to live on her own and graduate college. Or my little sister, who's the first grandchild to be in a serious relationship. So, I told my mom that no, I really didn't want to share the birthday party.

My mom replied that the idea was that the family party would be joint, but that we could do something at home with my friends on my actual birthday, and my dad even said that we'd still go out to eat on my actual birthday and celebrate as an immediate family, and I do appreciate that, but I just feel like I want some time on my 20th birthday for the rest of my family to just be focusing on me. I feel like we're gonna be there and that it's gonna be like a birthday party for Blake where I just happen to get presents too. We've had joint birthday parties with other family members before. There will be one cake, and one ""Happy Birthday"" song for the both of us. (Plus, Blake's mom tends to pick less-sugary alternatives for her kids' birthday cakes, so that would be a bummer too.) I also can't help but feel like Blake should get his own tenth birthday party without me sharing, considering that's a pretty big birthday to first step into the double-digits. 

I ended up telling my mom ""whatever, that's fine"" in the end because I can't really see that I was allowed to say no. She says it's just really hard to get all of our family together for birthdays nowadays and she doesn't want to go through the trouble of scheduling two May birthdays and trying to make everyone's schedule work. We've had birthdays before without trouble where a few members didn't show up, but I guess it would be too much work. I feel bad for really not wanting to share this and wishing my mom and her siblings could work harder to figure something out, but it doesn't seem like I have much of a choice. I'm seriously considering asking if we can just have Blake's party and then just have my family mail any gifts to our house.

My family member is convinced they're suffering from mold toxicity and it's hurting her and everyone around her ,ninthtale,1,MedicalMalpractice,0,"I'm just trying to know how I might be able to protect my sister and hopefully by extension society from a ""doctor"" whose genuine licensure is enabling her to destroy people's lives.

I don't need to go into depth here about what a scam mold toxicity is—I'm sure you all get enough people who think their bad dreams are caused by black mold. I'm aware it's used as a blanket reason for any illness under the sun, and to turn innocent (albeit gullible) people away from science and the help they need.

There's a certain [Diana Stafford](https://www.vahealthprovider.com/results_paid.asp?License_No=0101272929) who claims to be [""mold certified""](https://www.doctorstafford.com/) and to operate around the world (except, suspiciously, [in the EU](https://imgur.com/IVph5q1), where I assume her BS isn't tolerated) but who must in order to fend off liability add [that slimy, insidious disclaimer](https://imgur.com/l0sO0VZ) at the bottom of her website.

I needn't go into the whole story, but the effect of it is this: She and her ilk, and the Facebook groups that circlejerk each other over every sneeze, headache, and itch have driven my sister to the brink of homelessness. Nearly every member of our (very large) family are either unable or are no longer willing to take her in as she struggles to find work (because of flareups at the workplace that *must* be caused by a leaky faucet somewhere). She has turned to our siblings' children for a place to stay, but obviously neither they nor their roommates can reasonably sustain her.

She's hurt, lost, and she recently badly injured her foot, was just evicted from one of our siblings' homes, and instead of thinking she needs specific help, she has decided she is allergic to planet earth, and has lost all but a single dangling scrap of faith in modern medicine—and she is surely not the only one.

I cannot ask for help for her here, but I am wondering how I might be able to begin bringing some kind of hammer down on the scum that brought her to this place. I am currently in the process of [submitting a complaint form](https://www.dhp.virginia.gov/Complaints/Default2.aspx) in Virginia where this quack got her license, but I am wondering if that is all I can do, or if even that is something that can be done.",05-04-2024
Regret plastic surgery because of health anxiety and now it’s too late ,PuzzleheadedBag2906,1,AskDocs,1,"I’m 27 F
150 pounds
I take mirtazapine 30 mg
 and I’d say I’m healthy other than the fact that I vape nicotine. I smoked 11 years and have vaped for 5. It’s awful. 

I’ve had multiple surgeries over the last few years, I’ve had breast aug, nose job, lower Bleph, I had an awake bbl and revision Lipo and just had my 2nd bbl technically 3rd Lipo ( a year after the last)

For some reason before this surgery I was more nervous than any other. It was a new doctor and bbls are risky. I wanted it then I didn’t then I did. Well I got it on may 1st. Awake bbl, took around 3 hours start to finish. 
And I didn’t quit vaping. I cut down but I didn’t quit like an IDIOT. Believe me I tried. I threw out my vape tonight and I swear I’m done. But I can’t stop thinking about something bad happening during my healing, like a PE or blood clot. I’m doing everything I can. I’m wearing my garments my compression socks I’m walking a quarter mile every hour, drinking my water taking my vitamins getting my massages but they say you can get a blood clot for up to THREE months After. I was terrified of a fat embolism and I’ve been counting down the 5-7 days to be in the safe zone. I’m catching myself needing to take anxiety meds every single night because if I get ANY weird sensation I think something bad is happening and I want to go to the ER.

I’m obsessing over this bad and I can’t even tell if my sensations are real or anxiety. Please what do I do? I wish I didn’t do this and it’s too fucking late 😩 I hate this so much. I’m so scared ",05-04-2024

Best cities to live in the Southeast US as a computer science embedded enthusiast,maullarais,1,SameGrassButGreener,0,"So I'm currently trying to figure out where to move from my current location, which is a poorer LCOL area in the Southeast into one of the more populated area in the Southeast, primarily due to me wanting to stay closer to families and attempting to find any good roles that'll benefits my degree and experience. 

For context, I am 20M and currently in the process of getting my bachelor degree in Computer Science alongside with almost 2 YOE working as a security officer. I am mainly looking for roles in embedded engineering, and I plan on entering either a masters or a PhD programme after staying in the cities for roughly 5 years after. 

I also want to live in a roughly affordable area, where I could comfortably buy a home for under $250k-$300K USD and has a wide varieties of activities or a decently run airport so that I could go for vacations in other area. Crime and gun control are also a main quality of life issue for me, as I'd like to have some from of gun ownership that is locked in my safe at all time unless necessary. Also if there's a massive MMA scene that'd be great as well. 

So far the cities that I've narrowed it down to are 

* Atlanta, GA
* Athens, GA
* Asheville, NC
* Charlotte, NC
* Greenville, SC
* Miami, FL
* Raleigh, NC

Ideally if there's a city that'd be decent for embedded market, that'd also be a plus. I don't want to hear any advices regarding other markets, but I'm more than willing to give it a try if it has a decent future for it. ",05-04-2024
[PC] [2008-2015] Puzzle Adventure Game,LordGedelicious,1,tipofmyjoystick,0,"**Platform(s):** 

PC

**Genre:** 

Puzzle, Adventure

**Estimated year of release:** 

2008 to 2015, around that time I guess, I could be one or two years off though. It's on roughly the same era as the ""[Around the World in 80 Days](https://www.gametop.com/download-free-games/80-days/)"" or ""[Rise of Atlantis](https://www.gametop.com/download-free-games/rise-of-atlantis/)"" game. 

**Graphics/art style:**

It's similar to the art style of Tomb Raider or other similar games. 

**Notable characters:**

I don't remember any sorry, but I do remember the character we're playing as is a female archaeologist.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**

I barely remember it sorry but I think it's a tile matching game, similar to Jewel Quest or Candy Crush.

**Other details:**

The game opens up with the archaeologist working in the basement (or sub-basement) of a museum with a tall stone tablet. She experimented to put piles of gems (it's either gems or crystals, I forgot) in certain positions and orders, which opened up a portal to ""the lost city of gold?"" (please don't mind the term used here, i barely remember it. but it's supposed to be an ancient civilization with riches and treasures) I remember vividly there's 3 stages (with each containing multiple levels). The first one is the museum sub-basement, which ended with a portal of light being opened on the stone tablet. The second one is located on a mountain top, which also has marked positions of where to put the next pile of gems. This stage ended with a ray of light shot across the mountain to the entrance of the city. The third stage (this one might not be the stage right after the second one) is in front of a big large door inside the city. 

Other notable things is that for every level you complete, you'll be shown a new diary/notes from the main character we're playing as. Also, for every stage you complete, a newspaper will appear on the screen. The headlines of the newspaper is about the result or the effect of completing the stage (opening up the portal, finding the lost city, opening up the treasure vault).

Now that I think of it, I could've been mistaken about the first stage's ending. It's either opening up a portal, or highlighting a map on the stone tablet that points to the location of the second stage. Sorry it's been so long lol and this memory just resurfaced out of nowhere.

Trigeminal neuralgia and breastfeeding ,Frankiealbert,1,TrigeminalNeuralgia,0,Hi guys. I’ve just been diagnosed with TN. They want me to take carbamazepine but I have a 4 month old and I’m exclusively breastfeeding. They said out of all drugs for TN this is the safest and only a small amount will pass through breast milk. And the only side effect I might see in baby is drowsiness. Am I selfish for wanting to take the meds to stop the pain?? Has anyone else breastfed on this medication? She unfortunately won’t take a bottle so formula isn’t an option ,05-04-2024

Is he uninterested or just shy?,iatemyfireplace,1,Crushes,0,"So basically this guy was introduced to me by my friends. The whole thing started because I found him cute and then eventually he found out through said friend that I liked him so that was annoying. Fast forward a few months, I actually built up the courage to text him and he’s been pretty engaged in every convo we have (even though it is a bit awkward on both ends) and he answers pretty quickly. He even waves at me or says hey if he sees me at school. The problem is he never texts first or starts anything. I was told that he’s really really shy/awkward so maybe that’s why but tbh I don’t know. I’ve only had small talk with him in person and the rest of our texts were also pretty surface level which also kinda bothers me because I’ve known him for a few months now and I figured that we’d at least be a little closer. It also doesn’t help that we have no classes together. I know I should probably be patient but I feel like there’s a clock ticking on this situation since he’s going on vacation for the whole summer and I just want to know if he’s interested or not.

The Rise and Fall of the Big 3 Era,thesonicvision,1,nbadiscussion,0,"**First, some important notes:**

* For our purposes, a B3 (""Big 3"") **is a trio of players who were all proven #1 options** (and/or ""best players"") on different teams before they all came together on the same team. Furthermore, **all three must have played at a very high level right before they teamed up.**
* The B3 era we're concerned with begins with Pierce/KG/Allen on the Celtics in 2007.
* Hence, the Golden State Warriors' trio of Steph/Klay/Dray doesn't count. And the Lakers with Malone and Payton doesn't qualify either.

**Let's compare:**

* Celtics (KG, Pierce, Allen). Rings/Finals: 1/2.
   * Players had complementary skillsets, but joined a bit too late in their careers. Won right away, but a hard time in the playoffs. Great defensively, but surprisingly lacking offensively. Very brief, but memorable, moment in the sun.
* Heat (Bron, Wade, Bosh). Rings/Finals: 2/4.
   * Formed at the right time, but Wade and Bron had redundant skillsets. Also, Bosh was forced to play in a way that minimized his capabilities. Health concerns for Wade and Bosh forced the run to last for only 4 years. Bron, however, would famously go on to have a lengthy and productive post-Heat career.
* Lakers (Bryant, Howard, Nash). Rings/Finals: 0.
   * Yeah. Many predicted this would fail (myself included), while others thought they'd be a lock for 1 ring. Very polarizing team. Injuries, age, egos, and bad chemistry would cause this team to collapse very quickly. Each member of the B3 were certainly playing at a ""high level"" just the year prior (Nash was an All-Star and 9th in MVP voting despite averaging only 12 PPG), but it was also clear each of the B3 was going to crash quickly.

* Thunder (Westbrook, PG, Melo). Rings/Finals: 0.
   * Westbrook proved himself to be a #1 option after Durant departed, earning an MVP award. Melo was ready to finally take a step down in his career, and PG had a bit of time as a #1 in Indiana (but kinda always felt more like a #2, and would go on to always feel more like a #2). In hindsight, PG-- being a two-way player-- was the only member of the 3 who really can/could make nearly any team ""immediately better.""

In hindsight, PG-- being a two-way player-- was the only member of the 3 who really can/could make nearly any team ""immediately better.""
* Nets (Durant, Harden, Irving). Rings/Finals: 0.
   * Harden was a #1 on the Rockets for many years, and Irving had a brief moment as a #1 on the Celtics (thankfully, that experiment ended quickly and did not permanently hinder the development of Brown and Tatum). The Nets failed due to untimely injuries, egos, and antics from Irving. When Simmons replaced Harden, it was unclear if Simmons' strengths would outweigh his weaknesses. We all know what happened…    Harden was a #1 on the Rockets for many years, and Irving had a brief moment as a #1 on the Celtics (thankfully, that experiment ended quickly and did not permanently hinder the development of Brown and Tatum). The Nets failed due to untimely injuries, egos, and antics from Irving. When Simmons replaced Harden, it was unclear if Simmons' strengths would outweigh his weaknesses. We all know what happened…
* Suns (Durant, Booker, Beal). Rings/Finals: 0 (ongoing).
   * The Suns, after years of bottom-dwelling, ascended to the Finals with a particular roster: Cam Payne, Cam Johnson, Bridges, Ayton, Paul, Booker. They would trade all of them, save Booker, in hopes of a B3 bringing them to the promised land. Not sure why. They still have a chance of creating a winner. We'll see…
* Clippers (Leonard, PG, Harden). Rings/Finals: 0 (ongoing).
   * Just when it looked like Harden might be declining in Philly, he had a brilliant season and rejuvenated his career. However, Leonard's persistent load-managing and a lack of depth might eventually foil the Clippers. Westbrook is also on the team, but the wasn't playing at a high enough level to count as part of a B3 or ""Big 4."" He's a role player for the Clippers who sometimes has big moments. They still have a chance of creating a winner. We'll see...    Just when it looked like Harden might be declining in Philly, he had a brilliant season and rejuvenated his career.

They still have a chance of creating a winner. We'll see...

**Analysis:**

There are many winning formulas to a ring (heliocentric system, binary star system, the ""beautiful game"", and so on), but**the notion of a particular type of B3-- one where three current #1 options suddenly come together- and become an unstoppable force-- seems more myth than reality.**

Furthermore, it seems that all the recent B3 disappointments may be ending this era of ""nuclear proliferation,"" where teams were scrambling to have as many ""nukes"" as possible.

\*\*It's the organic ""Big 3s"" and ""Big 5s"" that win.\*\*These teams develop their players and discover they have something ""unfair"" that they can exploit within their roster. They might make one major trade, but that's usually it.

There was a time, not too long ago and due to the relative success of the Celts and the Heat, where hoops fans truly believed that putting three #1 options on a team would work itself out and lead to dominance. We were wrong.**We were ignoring the true makeup of most recent NBA champions:**

* 1 MVP-level player (or little-to-no conflicting redundancies among skill sets if there are multiple MVP-level players)
* a brilliant starting 5
* lots of shooting
* at least one, great, starting 3-and-D player
* fantastic ball movement
* great team defense
* examples: Raptors, Lakers, Bucks, Warriors, Nuggets

**I think the B3 era is over and I say, ""good riddance.""**",05-04-2024

Need help regarding the loan!!,Realistic-Eagle-5281,1,personalfinanceindia,0,"Hi reddit fam!

My dad has taken a loan of 30 lakhs in a society bank named “shiva bank”. He took this loan on flat interest. The motive behind taking this loan is to build shops and rent those shops. So now the thing is the revenue earn by these shops is going to interest. Principal amount is still 30 lakhs. Now the bank has offered to convert that loan into reducing interest. But they are asking my mom, me and my younger sister to sign the agreement form as well. 

Now my question is should we also have to sign to the agreement form? If anything happens to my dad, will I, my sister, and my mom become responsible for paying the loan? If this is the case, then I don’t want to sign nor my mom and sister has to. I have my own commitments. I am trying to come out my own debt trap. With this 30 lakhs, it will be very difficult for me to survive. Also my mom is a house wife and my sister is studying law. 

Hence, I want to ask is bank hiding something behind taking our signatures? Should my mom and my sister has to sign to this agreement? I don’t care about the property. My dad is already 55 years old. If he couldn’t able to pay the loan, then its fine for me. If bank sells the property then it is also fine for me. But with the responsibility of 30 lakhs coming on my head, I can take care of my parents in future. Even it becomes very difficult to survive for me. So should we have to sign to that agreement along with my dad?",05-04-2024

Black and tan won't separate. Need wisdom,DoomMushroom,1,beer,0,"I've never successfully gotten a black and tan to stay separate. Granted I've only tried twice. Both with a bent spoon. 

I'm also trying to venture out from Guinness & Harp/Bass.

Tonight I tried making a dessert black and tan by putting a chocolaty stout over a vanilla pale ale. But now I've got two mixed beers... again.

First question, does the stout/porter have to be nitro? I would think yes, but the clerk at the store said no, CO2 works fine. Against my judgement I went the beer with the flavor profile I wanted but it was C02.

Second, is there a way to look up densities? Should I just get a hydrometer and test some beers? Any weird tricks to checking beer compatibility? 

Technically there is a miniscule difference in liquid densities based on temperatures. Does it help to have the top beer a little warmer than the bottom?

Sudden myopia onset over 2 months- Or is it all in my head?,puppysilly_,1,AskDocs,1,"19F. 5'4, 124lb.

I have a very slight offset of my left eye (diagnosed at 16) that according to my eye doctor is getting better with time. I currently wear prism glasses to prevent it from causing me headaches. I have a family history of diabetes type 2. My dad wears glasses for astigmatism, he has general blurriness. I have dry eyes since moving to a less humid state. I eat well, but i've been mostly sedentary until about a month ago. I have chronic neck pain, headaches and TMJ pain.

A brief timeline:
- 3 months ago, I lost my prism glasses.
- 2 months ago, I went for my yearly vision appointment and got my glasses replaced as well.
- Over 1 month ago, I noted blurriness when looking at screens and lights (especially the letters on LED-lit keyboards) 
- Almost 1 month ago, I moved states. I noted nearsightedness on my drive there (don't worry, I was a passenger!) and a weird feeling in my left eyeball when I moved it side to side, almost like it was ""larger"" in the socket, and the feeling mostly went away after a nap, but not completely.

My last eye doctor visit was 2 months ago, and ~1 month ago, I noticed that I was experiencing nearsightedness that I had never experienced before, or at least never noticed. It seems to improve heavily when I put my glasses on, but the thing that confuses me is that, before this, I didn't notice a difference in my vision with vs without glasses.

When I went to get my frames adjusted at a walmart, I told the person adjusting them about my concerns and what I should do. She asked if diabetes runs in my family and I said yes, and she told me I should get checked out ASAP. I don't experience signs of type 2 diabetes to my best knowledge.

I don't know what it could be- anything, really. 

I'm going to get checked out soon, but I want to get opinions in the meantime.",05-04-2024

Therapist called me petty over daughter welfare concerns ,HardlyRad,1,therapy,0,"Am I overreacting? This week I talked to my therapist about the stress I’ve been dealing with learning that my daughter’s dad has been driving high with her in the car. She said it was petty and said the court would think that as well and may even try to take parenting time away from me. The past two weeks my daugter has come home smelling like a homeless person. I am not exaggerating, my whole family noticed it as the smell permeated the entire room she was in. My therapist said that may affect her self esteem but nothing that I said raised any risk to the child. If my child’s dad were to get pulled over & she was in the car I am sure they’d call CPS on him. I wanted to cry during session after she said that but kept it together for the call. I was very much looking forward to starting therapy again but feel super discouraged and don’t really want to meet with her again. I understand she’s probably seen some crazy things before but I feel like that was a weird reaction to me talking about the issue. ",05-04-2024

Bf (29M) grabbed a stripper’s butt and I’m (32F) uncomfortable,maanzzbb,1,relationships_advice,0,"My bf and I have been together for about 10 years. We’re not perfect, but for the most part we’ve been great. 

About a month ago, he was in Vegas on a guys trip and they went to a strip club. It was my bf’s first time and it was not planned (they had been drinking all day and all night, were approached by a promoter, and they all thought “Screw it, let’s go.”) They had strippers hanging around at their table doing their thing trying to get the guys to spend money. As the stripper was trying to entice him, he put his arm around her waist and grabbed her butt. Supposedly, he didn’t get a lap dance and didn’t go to the back room because he had already lost money gambling and didn’t want to lose more. Now, I will never know the whole truth because I wasn’t there and didn’t see it with my own eyes. 

Prior to going, he knew how I felt about strip clubs but still went. To top it off, he didn’t just look but also touched. What he did was so out of character. He doesn’t have a lot of friends in our area and rarely goes out, so I’m sure he got excited. He told me what happened first thing the next morning. We’ve talked about it so many times and he’s been very apologetic, but I can’t seem to get over it. Am I overreacting?

Final thoughts on the show,ExpressionJust1765,1,ONETREEHILL,0,"A month or two ago I came on here talking abt how much I hated Dan and how he was a narcissist, but after watching the whole show i understand why a lot of ppl have a love-hate relationship w him. Yes he's an awful person but deep down he does have some good intentions especially about protecting his son and grandkids. His character development and his complexity makes him one of my fav characters and his redemption arc was good, so I understand the hype. Also I've seen ppl talk abt how the last two season of this show was rlly bad, but honestly I loved it all. This was a show about good and bad people doing good and bad things with love, family, and friendship in between and I ate it up! It made me think of my own life and relationships and made me feel hopeful for having a family in the feature w the loml. I loved brooke she was my fav character, Haley was awesome too, Nathan was such a good dad and husband, clays struggles w his mental health, Nathan getting kidnapped, hell I even started liking Chris Keller and that man annoyed tf out of me😭I rlly liked chases relationship w Chuck as well as Millie's and mouths relationship. I rlly liked the whole show in general even tho some parts were very melodramatic but also not. Ok last thing who is the little girl and boy in the last scene??😭😭is that supposed to be the baker BOYS? Idk if maybe they made one of them trans or what but maybe the writers forgot they're supposed to be twin boys lol. Cause it would show the couple and then the next shot was their kids and I was confused seeing it show brooke and Julian then flashes to a little boy and girl. Did anyone notice this too? Anyways that's my thoughts on the show I rlly liked it! ",05-04-2024

I feel unsafe due to new neighbor,marssbarss2020,1,Advice,0,"Hey guys,

There is a new neighbor across from me and she recently moved in. I have been here for 1 year now and I never had any problems until she moved here.

Long story short, every time I step out of my apartment, she unlocks her door at the same time as me and starts asking me about very personal questions, including who lives with me, where I work, etc.

The 1st time it happened, I thought she was being friendly. But the same thing has happened 2 more times, the 2nd time I was getting my laundry and she unlocked her door at the same time, started to ask me what I'm doing and pretending she was just looking in the hallway then went back inside.

The third time happened this morning. I got out of my house at 6:30 am and she unlocked her door 2 seconds after and then stepped out. This time, I looked at her and didn't say much. Her excuse of why she opened her door was that she ""heard noise"" and wanted to see who was there. Then she asked me where I work. I replied ""why do you want to know"". That's when she got pretty verbally aggressive. She said she reported me and all the other tenants because ""someone stole her car"". I quickly responded with ""well then I'm about to go report you for harassment and invasion of privacy"" and then I just walked away as she continued being aggressive.

I feel very unsafe and I'm not sure what to do. I spoke with leasing office, they said they cannot do anything to evict her. All they can do is send her a notice. They also told me to call police and file a report, which I did, but the police came, took my report and didn't do anything further.

I still feel very unsafe to the point that I'm scared of stepping out my apartment now. I feel like she is monitoring or watching me since she always opens her door when I do, especially since she came out today at 6:30 am. This is the 3rd time this happened.

Any advice?

Thank you guys in advance!",05-04-2024
