My ranking of Queen's albums:,NewPatron-St,0,1cjrzms,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1cjrzms/my_ranking_of_queens_albums/,0,"I love Queen, I don't hate any of these albums I love them all but I like some more than others, also Queen never made a bad album:

1. Queen II (1974)

Topping my list is Queen II. This sophomore experimental masterpiece is a symphony of innovation and audacious artistry which showcases the band's early musical prowess. With its sprawling epics, theatrical flourishes, and introspective moments, Queen II epitomizes the band's eclectic and experimental spirit. Both sides White & Black showcasing their unparalleled ability to craft unforgettable soundscapes.

Favourite songs: ""Father to Son"", ""White Queen (As It Began)"", ""Ogre Battle"", ""The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke"", ""The March of the Black Queen"" & ""Seven Seas of Rhye""

2. Innuendo (1991)

A poignant and defiant farewell from a band facing the twilight of its illustrious career, Innuendo is a triumph of both artistry and human spirit. Freddie Mercury's struggle with illness lends an emotional weight to the songs, adding depth and resonance to their already impressive melodies. The album combines elements of rock, opera, and Middle Eastern influences, Innuendo radiates with defiance and triumph making it both a celebration of the past and a bittersweet acceptance of the future.

Favourite songs: ""Innuendo"", ""I'm Going Slightly Mad"", ""Headlong"", ""I Can't Live with You"", ""All God's People"", ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" & ""The Show Must Go On""

3. Sheer Heart Attack (1974)

Queen's third album fuses the raw energy of their early work with the sophistication of the prog rock era, Sheer Heart Attack is a testament to Queen's versatility and growing confidence. This album delivers an infectious blend of hard rock, theatrical bombast and witty lyrical brilliance. Sheer Heart Attack showcases their growing confidence, eclectic versatility and boundless creativity.

Favourite songs:Favourite songs:""Brighton Rock"", ""Killer Queen"", ""Flick of the Wrist"", ""Now I'm Here"", ""In the Lap of the Gods"", ""Stone Cold Crazy"" & ""In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited""

4. A Day at the Races (1976)

A whimsical companion piece to A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races is a tour de force of layered harmonies, theatrical arrangements, and unforgettable songwriting. The band's harmonies and complex arrangements soar throughout the album. Following the triumph of A Night at the Opera, Queen doubled down on their operatic aspirations with A Day at the Races Queen showcases their masterful songwriting and playful sense of humour.

Favourite songs: ""Tie Your Mother Down"", ""You Take My Breath Away‚Äù, ‚ÄùThe Millionaire Waltz"", ""Somebody to Love"", ""White Man‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood Old-Fashioned Lover Boy"" & ""Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)""

5. A Night at the Opera (1975)

Often hailed as Queen's magnum opus, an epic masterpiece that defies categorization, A Night at the Opera is a musical extravaganza. Few albums have had the cultural impact of A Night at the Opera. This is the album that catapulted Queen to global superstardom. A Night at the Opera stands as Queen's magnum opus.

Favourite songs: ""Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)"", ""I'm in Love with My Car"", ""You're My Best Friend"", ""'39"", ""The Prophet's Song"", ""Love of My Life"" & ""Bohemian Rhapsody""

6. Queen (1973)

The self-titled debut album is a remarkable introduction to the world of Queen. It showcases the band's diverse influences, from heavy rock to glam and introduces many of their signature elements. While not as musically complex as their later work, including soaring harmonies, catchy hooks, theatrical flair, youthful exuberance and Freddie Mercury's powerful vocals. Queen's self-titled debut album is a raw and vibrant introduction to their signature sound.

Favourite songs: ""Keep Yourself Alive"", ""Doing All Right"", ""Great King Rat"", ""My Fairy King"", ""Liar"" & ""Jesus""

7. A Kind of Magic (1986)

A Kind of Magic is a product of Queen's collaboration with the film industry, providing the soundtrack for the Highlander movie. The album is a collection of catchy and anthemic rock songs and cinematic power ballads. The album demonstrates Queen's ability to adapt to the changing musical landscape of the 1980s as well as their enduring optimism and spirit.

Favourite songs: ""One Vision"", ""A Kind of Magic"", ""Pain Is So Close to Pleasure"", ""Friends Will Be Friends"", ""Who Wants to Live Forever"", ""Don't Lose Your Head"" & ""Princes of the Universe""

8. News of the World (1977)

News of the World represents a shift towards a more straightforward rock sound. After experimenting with A Day at the Races and A Night at the Opera, Queen returned to a more stripped-down sound with News of the World. The album features some of Queen's most iconic anthems but it does have its share of experimental and introspective moments which have become anthems at sporting events and rallies worldwide of unity and empowerment.

Favourite songs: ""We Will Rock You"", ""We Are the Champions"", ""Sheer Heart Attack"", ""Spread Your Wings"", ""Fight from the Inside"" & ""Get Down, Make Love""

9. The Miracle (1989)

The Miracle is a return to Queen's more progressive and experimental classic Queen sound. The album is characterized by layered harmonies, intricate arrangements, a hopeful and uplifting tone. The band's harmonies shine throughout the album, creating a cohesive and atmospheric soundscape. The Miracle is a bittersweet testament to the band's resilience and their enduring bond with their fans.

Favourite songs: ""The Miracle"", ""I Want It All"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""Breakthru"", ""Rain Must Fall"" & Scandal""

10. Jazz (1978)

Jazz, despite its deceptive title, is a genre-defying album that incorporates elements of rock and pop demonstrating Queen's willingness to push their musical boundaries while still keeping their quirky sense of humour which is what I love about Queen, their quirky and enjoyable.

Favourite songs: ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", ""Bicycle Race"", ""Let Me Entertain You"" & ""Don't Stop Me Now""

11. The Works (1984)

The Works is a transition album, marking a shift towards more commercial and pop-oriented sounds of synth-pop and hard rock. The Works is a transitional album that bridges the gap between Queen's more operatic sound and their later pop-rock era. The album is a reflection of the band's ability to appeal to both casual and dedicated fans. The Works showcases the band's ability to create memorable and catchy songs that appeal to a wide audience.

Favourite songs:¬† ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""It's a Hard Life"", ""Machines (or 'Back to Humans')"", ""I Want to Break Free"", ""Hammer to Fall"" & ""Is This the World We Created...?""

12. The Game (1980)

Queen's first 80s, the first to have Freddie to have his signature moustache and the first Queen album to use synthesizers. The Game is a strong album that features a mix of hard rock, pop and funk¬† elements. Queen's experimentation with synthesizers is evident throughout the album. The Game showcases the band's ability to create memorable and catchy songs that appeal to a wide audience.

Favourite songs: ""Play the Game"", ""Dragon Attack"", ""Another One Bites the Dust"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""Don't Try Suicide"" & ""Save Me""

13. Hot Space (1982)

Hot Space is not a bad album, it‚Äôs not Queen's best but it is bad. Hot Space is Queen's most experimental and divisive album. Hot Space is a departure from Queen's previous sound incorporating elements of funk, dance and pop, but it was met with mixed reactions from fans and critics but it demonstrates Queen's willingness to explore different directions.

Favourite songs: ""Staying Power"", ""Back Chat"", ""Action This Day"", ""Put Out the Fire"", ""Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)"", ""Calling All Girls"", ""Las Palabras de Amor (The Words of Love)"" & ""Under Pressure""

14. Made in Heaven (1995)

Made in Heaven is a posthumous release, assembled from Freddie Mercury's final recordings before his death. The album is a poignant, fitting tribute and a bittersweet tribute to Mercury's legacy and a fitting end to Queen's extraordinary career.

Favourite songs: ""It's a Beautiful Day"", ""Made in Heaven"", ""Let Me Live"", ""I Was Born to Love You"", ""Heaven for Everyone"", ""Too Much Love Will Kill You"" & ""A Winter's Tale""

15. Flash Gordon (1980)

The soundtrack to the cult classic campy sci-fi film Flash Gordon is is generally considered a minor work in Queen's discography. The album contains both instrumental and vocal tracks features a mix of hard rock, pop and theatrical elements. I love Flash Gordon, it‚Äôs a fun movie and the soundtrack is great with the film but I don't find myself listen to the soundtrack unless I'm watching the film along with it.

Favourite songs: ""Flash's Theme"", ""Flash to the Rescue"" & ""The Hero""",05-04-2024,0,0,discussion

Your opinion on investing in gold,PuddleSailor,1,1cjrzk7,Gold,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/1cjrzk7/your_opinion_on_investing_in_gold/,0,"Hello Y‚Äôall, 

I‚Äôm very curious about this community and the collection of physical gold assets.  Can you guys explain me the benefit of collecting coins and bars.  I always thought it was safer to invest in Paper Gold in the form of an investment account and believe physical gold is risky as it could be stolen and you never actually get to buy it at spot price.  You might also have to invest in safes or a deposit box.  Additionally, gold is still a speculative market that counters the stock market so it can both appreciate or depreciate in value, so even if it holds value well, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to buy a treasury bond that has 0 theoretical risk or a stock in a Blue Chip company that wouldn‚Äôt go bankrupt easily?

I was so insecure about my hair that i would just braid them and never open them..and only before hairwash
Now when i saw my hair so frizzy and thin I'm more insecure about it although my doctor said to not use anything with chemical...even by following I can't see anything good and my hair became worst(i used to have wavy hairs)

So i came up with this plum avocado range for wavy hair...and i ordered their shampoo, conditioner,serum and hair mask... wanted to know if it's good or not (can it cause hairfall??)

If I knew this would have a regular ass lantern color I wouldn't have bought it. Would've been neat if the effect was shown in store but the shop leaves a lot to be desired.

It has now been 8 months of me working for this agency; overnight, I‚Äôll add  and let me tell you, it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm in high school again. 

- employees are overworked 
- nobody cares for the 3rd shift

My roommate got shitty with me for moving my belongings out of our shared townhouse early. AITAH?,123456789_00,1,1cjrzfh,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cjrzfh/my_roommate_got_shitty_with_me_for_moving_my/,0,"In a nutshell, our landlord told us he is selling our townhouse we've been living in for a couple of years now. This was unexpected but he was nice about it and was going to allow us to finish our our original lease, but we obviously could not re-sign.  We had been living together for 4 years at that point. So we know eachother well.

I decided to move in with my boyfriend (which is totally fine and honestly we wanted to do that anyways). My roommates got a different apartment (also totally fine). Let it be known - we ALL paid April rent and April bills, so no issue there.

We had to be out May 1st because that's when my roommate's new lease started. This was also totally okay. I was working a lot, and also traveled out of the country the last week of April, so I started slowly transferring my belongings to my boyfriend's house over the month of April because I didn't want to wait til the last minute and be stressed. I think this was not unreasonable. Especially since I was going to be gone the last week of April.

WELL. My roommate apparently did not agree. While I was out of town, he sent me a dramatic and very rude text, bitching at me about how ""every time he goes to look for something, it's gone"". And about how I took stuff that he needed to ""fix stuff up with"" (like I had a tool kit etc for minor stuff). At this point, we had like 2 weeks left in the townhouse.

He never once asked me for any of these things, or expressed his frustration, until he exploded on me and sent me a nasty text about all this. I kept my cool majorly, and told him he was being rude and unreasonable. I told him that it seems like he is frustrated for me moving MY stuff on my timeline, and not his. I do not have to ask his permission to move my things. I told him that if he needed something of mine, he is more than welcome to ask me, and I'd be happy to bring it back and let him use it. Truthfully, it made me realize how much I actually bought for the household, the vast majority of items belonged to me, but I never cared at all if he used them. Our living situation was mostly just fine.

AITA for moving my stuff out (slightly) early and apparently hugely inconveniencing my (dramatic) roommate? He's never made any attempts to acknowledge his behavior or apologize. ",05-04-2024,1,0,

Ein gro√üer, alter Spiegel hing im Flur, ein √úberbleibsel des Vorbesitzers. Jedes Mal, wenn ich daran vorbeiging, hatte ich das unbehagliche Gef√ºhl, beobachtet zu werden.

Eines Abends, als ich mich im Spiegel betrachtete, bemerkte ich etwas Seltsames: Mein Spiegelbild schien einen Moment l√§nger zu z√∂gern, bevor es meine Bewegungen nachahmte. Ich rieb mir die Augen und sch√ºttelte den Kopf, √ºberzeugt davon, dass meine Ersch√∂pfung mir Streiche spielte.

Die n√§chsten Tage konnte ich den Gedanken nicht loswerden. Es war, als h√§tte ich einen stillen Beobachter, der mich st√§ndig verfolgte. Jedes Mal, wenn ich schnell den Kopf drehte, schien mein Spiegelbild einen Bruchteil einer Sekunde hinterherzuhinken.

Besessen davon, das Geheimnis zu l√ºften, stellte ich eine Kamera auf, die auf den Spiegel gerichtet war. Ich wollte beweisen, dass es nur meine Einbildung war. Die Kamera lief die ganze Nacht durch. Am n√§chsten Morgen √ºberpr√ºfte ich das aufgenommene Material, mein Herz pochte vor nerv√∂ser Erwartung.

Das Video zeigte zun√§chst nichts Ungew√∂hnliches. Doch dann, mitten in der Nacht, als der Flur in Dunkelheit geh√ºllt war, bewegte sich mein Spiegelbild. Es lehnte sich vor, blickte sich um, als ob es sicherstellen wollte, dass niemand zuschaute, und dann ‚Äì es l√§chelte. Ein kaltes, berechnendes L√§cheln, das mir das Blut in den Adern gefrieren lie√ü.

Ich sprang zur√ºck, mein Atem stockte. Dies konnte nicht sein. Mein Spiegelbild hatte sein eigenes Leben? Panisch griff ich nach einem Hammer und schlug auf den Spiegel ein. Das Glas zersplitterte in tausend St√ºcke, jedes spiegelte mein entsetztes Gesicht wider.

Seitdem vermeide ich Spiegel. Ich habe alle aus meiner Wohnung entfernt. Doch manchmal, wenn ich an Schaufenstern vorbeigehe oder eine gl√§nzende Oberfl√§che sehe, f√ºrchte ich, das Gesicht wiederzusehen ‚Äì das andere Ich, das mich immer noch beobachtet.

I might get a lot of hate from this but it has to be said. the bug is within our community.,flkuth,1,1cjrze5,FTMMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMMen/comments/1cjrze5/i_might_get_a_lot_of_hate_from_this_but_it_has_to/,0,"Its time to face the truth and see how certain people in our community plays a role in driving transphobia. 

no offense but i highly blame the lgbtq community for coming up with so many more pronouns and subtypes of each gender identity and sexual orientation its so complicated now‚Ä¶.. so many umbrellas‚Ä¶.. and some play with being trans, some take T cause its just available for them.

 some pose as complete women and love being women and love their female anatomy and face zero dysphoria but call themselves a trans man and go by he.

all of these poeple ruined it for people who are simple, going through hell and severe dysphoria and binary to pass and be accepted lets be honest here. 

as a binary transgender man and i dont even understand these umbrellas and i am extremely mad at how certain people within the lgbtq community and trans community made being trans a joke just cause they took hormones cause they were available these people that detransition and blame it on everyone but themsleves when in reality its on them for being stupid and making a huge decision without thinking about it harming the trans reputation in the process by going online and having a tantrum blaming everyone but themselves for their poor choices , lets be real here yeah? 

some people just becuase they didnt fit in any of the boxes and labels so they made a new one using the name TRANS and didnt think  of the harm it could cause for the trans community. On the transmasc sub, most of the people there are posing as women and are happy with their female anatomy and happy with being women but call themselves trans men.. 

just because i am a trans man i do not need to accept everyone in the community some of those people like the ones i mentioned have caused severe harm for the trans community and trans people who are legit suffering from extreme dysphoria  now im not saying understanding something  makes it okay to hate on people and misgender them!! but its just its time to reflect on our communities and see that the harm has been that has been caused within the community  came from people within the community.

Black mask output when inpainting instead of inpainting results,SDuser12345,1,1cjrzdh,StableDiffusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1cjrzdh/black_mask_output_when_inpainting_instead_of/,0,"Haven't run into this with ComfyUI yet (but would imagine fix will be the same if you encounter) but for A1111 and forge, if you are running inpainting and generation seems normal, but at the end, you end up  with just a black mask where your mask was, you can of course close and relaunch your UI, but simply switch checkpoints and image will generate fine, or you can switch checkpoints to whatever, run a generation, then switch back to original checkpoint and you will be fine as well. 

Figured I would share as I tested every possible setting that might be causing it when it occured, reloading base image, redrawing mask, Denoise strengths, cfg scales,  soft inpainting (all settings), controlnet (on and off all settings), FreeU, SAG, Hypertile, Kohya HR fix, LatentModifer, and neveroom, and none made a difference. Simply switching checkpoints resolves. There are no console error messages. Switching back to preferred checkpoint works after as well. 

Hope this helps anyone with crazy image inpainting processes like I run. I did not test VAE swapping from automatic before finding this fix, so that is worth a shot, but this will fix for sure. If someone runs into this test VAE swapping as well and leave results here before fixing with checkpoint swap. I have a suspicion what is going on, but need confirmation. 

TLDR, black output in inpainting, checkpoint somehow fubar, switch checkpoints and switch back.

Questions for the Enlightened,Bisquait,1,1cjrzab,ConanExiles,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConanExiles/comments/1cjrzab/questions_for_the_enlightened/,0,"A few questions I had - some about purges, others in general  Thank you in advance for taking the time to read, and replying if you have some insight.

..

So, definitely having some fun with purges.  Have worked my way up to level 5 so far, and have enough gold to probably get to 8.. but taking my time doing each level one-at-a-time.  However, a couple of questions have come up, that I don't see an answer for.  So I'm hoping you, fellow exile, can help enlighten me.

1 - There are about a dozen items labeled as ""treasure"" that you get from adventuring around.  For the longest time, I just thought they were more ""home decor"", until I started learning about purges.  So, I grab everything labeled as ""treasure"" and take it over to my purge base.  But the coffer will only let me put in certain items, like teeth necklaces and that, maybe half of the various things that are labeled 'treasure'.  Other stuff, like the Gilded Harp, it won't allow me to put in the chest.  So, my questions would be, is this a glitch? or .. what's the point of having stuff labeled as ""treasure"", but not let you use it as such?

2 - This is in reference to the big chests that you can get from the purge camp. Big chest, big cat, etc..  you can pick them up and waddle back to your purge base, as long as you don't need to jump.  What's the purpose of these things?  They don't add to your purge value.  You can't add them to your own chest or anything.  All you can do is put them in the room with your coffer.  But why?  .. do they somehow increase the purge camp loot? .. and I've also noticed that while you have one next to your coffer, there will not be one at the purge camp.  But after about 3 successful purges, it disappears from your base, and the next round the purge base will have one again.

3 - A user named jenmacha did an awesome writeup about how to get a purge to spawn.  I seem to have no problem getting it to spawn, however after the 2nd or 3rd wave (occassionally on the first), it'll just decide that people can't get to the treasure any more, and quit.  Then the next attempt, the purge will play all the way through without a hitch.  I'm still experimenting to re-create the issue consistently enough to figure out what's happening.  My suspicion is that thralls are aggro-ing against a wall and with enough of them there, they start blocking the corridor for the rest to get by.  I'm moving my archers to more strategic areas with big open areas under them so that, even if they get aggro-ed, it wont block the path.  More testing to follow.

4 - Does anyone know a way to ""re-box"" a thrall?  You capture one then break them on the wheel.  Now at this point, they are just an icon. You can put them in your inventory, store them in a cabinet (I currently have 2.5 cabinets, or about 50-60 named tier4 thralls like this).  But, once you pull them out, give them armor & weapons and level them up to 20.. is there a tricky way to get them back in the cabinet?  I know you can only have 20 or so active at one time. But I thought it'd be cool if I could put one away, pull out another newbie, and be leveling him/her up while I'm running around.  Then, the cabinets would be full of trained and ready thralls, instead of newbies.  Obviously, this only refers to thralls that can 'follow' you, archers fighters dancers.  Skill/tradecraft thralls easily go back to icon form.

5 - Possilby a silly noob question here.  When I first started playing, I tried single player. After that nightmare and reading up about all the crashes and having them happen to me, and losing so many hours of building, I just went out and bought my own server to play on, as PvE.  I've only played there, and haven't tried any other servers.  My question is - if I go log onto a new server to try it out, do I start over from level zero again?  Does my character skills/knowledge all go with me?  How about body and backpack inventory?  Then of course, when I go back and log back in to my own server, is it restored how it was, or?

  
Thank you again for any advice!",05-04-2024,1,0,General

VTO Conspiracy,Cronizone,1,1cjrz9t,AmazonFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/1cjrz9t/vto_conspiracy/,1,"So I started thinking about VTO more and never truly understood it. Why would companies actively offer time off to their employees? Wouldn‚Äôt you think they want all hands on deck at all times? After all Amazon is a pretty important company.

Then I started to realize something. The sounds in the walls. Usually, Amazon (at least in my building) will play music. Sometimes when that music plays there‚Äôs a sound that emits from the walls. One time when I heard the sound my brain shut off for 5 minutes and then I rewoke putting a jiffy into a tote. Then I panicked a bit as I blacked out and didn‚Äôt even realize it. But then I understood what the sound did. It took control of me; it made me have an out of body experience. Like I was out of my own control.

I think Amazon needs people to take time off occasionally and makes sure their workers get enough time away from the building due to not wanting to poison their workers with their evil mind control sound emitting wall technology. That way they can continuously use it and not allow their workers to either become immune or peoples tolerance levels to sky rocket.

I‚Äôm going to try and figure out if I can record the sound again tonight but I don‚Äôt want to post as it‚Äôs against policy to show your warehouse, but I need to get this sound recorded just in case something else happens to me. There was another time I woke up doing safety stretches and was guiding people. I would never do that unless I was under some mind control.

i feel like maybe that's why a lot of things that bother other subs don't really bother me. passive aggressive staff, sure annoying but whatever i'm here to work. not being invited to school functions, eh that's fine i'm here to be with the kids as the adult and enjoy my breaks alone. etc, etc. i don't ask for much but the basics. lesson plans, respect from students, admin that will back me at least a little, access to bathroom/ lounge, etc.

but the one thing ive realized i CANNOT stand is when i can't pick up a job that i honestly expected to get. let me explain. there is a teacher i've had a good relationship with and she has my number (as most teachers i've previously subbed for do when i like their class), and she will text me asking if x,y,z dates work for me to sub. i always try to honor when a teacher asks for that because, i know for a lot of kids they like having a repeat sub. especially for this class which is SPED. 

the problem is that she never books it. i will always take mental note to not book that day. but once i got a message from her for one date and another teacher in the same school asked if i can cover that date. i said ""sorry i already accepted it from teacher x"" come to find out the other teacher decided she didn't want me. luckily i subbed the other class but the first teacher tried to do it AGAIN. then ghosted again. it's seriously so annoying. if you want me to sub you need to stick with it or tell me you don't need a sub anymore, because if not you're getting in the way of me subbing elsewhere. every other teacher who requests me sticks through with it and it'll show on the system. idk i just don't like the ghosting üò≠ 

i think for me im also bummed bc i really liked that class and there was a young girl who came from my culture. i sensed a lot of cultural nuances the rest of the staff couldn't pick up on including how parents interacted. like once they almost let her grab a ham sandwich -.- (she's muslim)",05-04-2024,1,0,Rant

I want to talk about what I think is the balance made by the arrow.,Majestic_Mechanic_33,1,1cjrz8j,helldivers2,https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/comments/1cjrz8j/i_want_to_talk_about_what_i_think_is_the_balance/,0,"Use Google Translate below
I want to state my conclusion here: Arrow has no idea what type of game it is making.
The balance team of Arrow points out that they have participated in the army to suppress the opinions of players, but the performance of combat in the game is not like the battlefield. The combat distance in the game should be within 200 meters, which leads to the fact that shotguns (Arrow believes that shotguns should do better in melee combat). Better knockback and better penetration? ) appears to be too powerful.
Among rifles and others, long-range engagement rifles do not perform as well as submachine guns in the game because there is no suitable engagement distance, or because the enemy's firepower is stronger than ours. This is caused by the engagement distance in the game.
Arrow tried to refer to other FPS and competitive games to balance a game that is basically a CQB battle. This is a very mistake, causing the game to become too powerful with shotguns, but players all know that shotguns are only enough. , he does not replace everything on higher difficulties, he is just easier to use than other weapons.
The balance of arrows simply believes that if a weapon has a high usage rate, it is very powerful, and does not consider whether it is caused by other weapons being too weak (although they seem to have realized this problem in recent updates). The weakening of a weapon is far greater than the strengthening of a weapon, and it should be done step by step.
 Oh, and I even forgot about the recoilless rifle featured in the Arrow design. For the weapons that used HEAT before, I thought that even though Arrow thought it could only use armor-piercing warheads, why did it give an unreasonable 50% damage reduction? Because the arrow warheads would reduce the jet after penetrating the armor, but what kind of creature's body would eat it? An exploding artillery shell will reduce the jet flow in the circle like a tank? This creature is not even shaken by the explosion of a cannonball! Not to mention, the explosion shock effect of the arrow's flash bomb can be greater than the explosion effect of a larger caliber artillery shell. 
I doubt that the balance team actually played the games they made, or even played HellDiver. The previous balance was nostalgic (it may not have been perfect, but it certainly allowed the game to continue to evolve). 
My idea is not completely correct, but I still hope to balance it carefully.",05-04-2024,1,0,General

I recently have become enamoured with this specific song as It was rather catchy, Out of all the lost media that is now invading my youtube feed this specific song has genuinely been the one that is the most findable (Besides the NSFW porno discovery I have read about from Carl92)

 I would like to begin this thread by first of all stating two things, The first being I was not alive when this song was created or played publicly (Which I will get to in a second.) 

The second point being that my connections and understanding of this song are very loose and vague and this is not a promise of an end to this story at all it is simply a lead that may turn out results. This is something we are all trying to achieve, So anyway let me get into this.

I was born and raised within the UK and whilst obviously anyone who listens to the audio + extended snippet Pilo provided can tell it is blatantly a clubbing house mix from the late 90's to early 2000's. I have shown this audio to a total of three people who at that point in time would have possibly been in those environments during that time. 2 out of three have said they have could have possibly heard the song one of which was adamant they had heard it but could not finger it (In their words). This is a rather big development at-least in my view and here is the actual the fact.

First of all the lyrics of the song (Which I made sure to explain to the people I was asking) Are oddly specific and yes whilst there are songs out there which do use similar lines at certain points to match the tail-end of the song and upon asking these two people in particular were adamant that the lyrics I quoted were correct and to further this upon listening to the actual audio snippet they were 100% sure this was what they heard.

The next fact is the user who shared the audio originally 'Pilo' has made requests for many other songs and despite a few classics they are normally house-mix songs which are normally played in clubs and a few of these have been confirmed to be used in clubs during that time period.

All three people who were asked (Without doxxing them or sharing personal info) were in the age-range of people who would have been clubbing during that time or at-least in an environment where they would have heard this music (Possibly).

This concludes to me, during my search that the lore of this being some kinda of cheesy dirty movie flick is incorrect and alongside that it also erases the possibility in my brain that the music was used in some sort of commercial.

The people I have talked to are all 40+ and tell me during that time period many songs were played and that there are probably many more songs that will forever be forgotten because nobody ever bothered to save them.

So whilst this is not conclusive I truly believe that 2/3 40 year olds say they are sure that they have heard this means the search narrows to UK clubbing music in the early 90's - early 2000's and whilst this is not exactly an amazing discovery because people theorised this already I do believe it gives us an area of search.

Help fever reduction ,deedeez2309,1,1cjrz6r,ScienceBasedParenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/1cjrz6r/help_fever_reduction/,0,"
My 4 year old spiked a fever randomly today. He wasn‚Äôt acting unusual he felt very warm so I checked his temperature. Sure enough he was about 99.9 and 101. I gave him Tylenol around 4:50pm. An hour passed and he was still showing 99.9. Took him to the emergency room to explain that it has not gone down. 

They said it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlow grade‚Äù fever so not much they can do. Tested him for strep only that came back negative. Said right now they‚Äôre not seeing much Covid flu or rsv so it‚Äôs most likely just a random virus he caught. 

Sent home he was still having a fever. 
It is not 10:20pm and still has not broken the fever he was at 101 again.

He unfortunately is allergic to ibuprofen so all we can give him is Tylenol.

I need tips on how to bring down the fever naturally at this point it‚Äôs my only option. I‚Äôve tried the wet rag no clothes and not much of change. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Question - Link not required

I had bachelor's degree in Business and also had some experiences in marketing and customer experience so business-side things are quite natural for me as PM. However, I have zero technical knowledge which makes me so overwhelmed when it comes to technical solutions. I usually define problems and solutions rather from business-perspective along with clarified requirements and wireframes of how the outcome would look like. I let developers decide how to implement technically and rely on developers to estimate tasks. Of course it is parts of their jobs and I think developers may like having voice in solutions rather just doing what is told. When there are technical issues during development period like things go harder than expected, I technically cannot help them. I just clarify how the issues affect overall outcome and progress to refine requirements, prioritize or deprioritize other tasks accordingly.  
I feel useless and helpless sometimes. Is it typical as PM. Any advice for non-tech PM?

And also when Nana and her friends, exclude Kyouya, escape from the camp with Nakajima, we can see how exhausted he is and he is almost look like his gonna turn to the Enemy of Humanity but not full yet. I was wondering if there's really a cure for it? Either they gonna solve it with the power of friendship and forgiveness whatever, or they really need someone to be a cure.

I swore I read somewhere that someone said what if Kyouya is the cure? His talent is immortality and youth, not to mention he can heal himself without any need of medical attention or some talent that can cure him. But if he can also turn to Enemy of Humanity, then there's really no hope...

~~Also me thinking, that Enemy of Humanity might be the cause of mental health that the talented have reached their limits. Remember Nana's victims are mostly mentally unstable or just straight up psychopath, but none of them reach the point to turn to Enemy of Humanity. Until Nakajima suddenly turn to one, even if it's not the full one, he still turn to one.~~

AITAH for getting mad at my friend for saying I have stalk-home syndrome for my boyfriend?,Pingpong_120,1,1cjrz4s,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cjrz4s/aitah_for_getting_mad_at_my_friend_for_saying_i/,0,"I(f21) have been dating my boyfriend (m21) for about a year and half. We‚Äôve been through a lot of things over the past year and it‚Äôs been a struggle justifying to others why we stay together. So to begin around October of last year I started college five hours away from home. He knew I was going to school far away before we really started dating. And when the time came for me to leave I considered staying for the sake of our relationship. Stupid I know. He convinced me to go to school anyway and that our relationship would be fine.
 
Fast forward to school and I find out that he‚Äôs been cheating on me. His best friend texted me out of no where with screen shots of my boyfriend alluding to the idea of him cheating on me, not outwardly admitting to it tho. 
My boyfriend‚Äôs reasoning was that he didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd last and he was really struggling with the distance. I was furious and asked him why he didn‚Äôt just breakup with me before seeing other people if he genuinely didn‚Äôt wanna be long distance. He said he tried and to be fair he did. During my second month at school we fought and he wanted to break up but I begged him to stay because I was already going through it moving so far away and dealing with financial difficulties, me and my dad were at odds about my decisions regarding school, my dad knows exactly what to say to make me feel horrible about myself. Going through a breakup would‚Äôve destroyed my mental state. 

We eventually had a four hour conversation talking about boundaries and trust, he said he felt trapped and that if he left me I‚Äôd unalive myself, I reassured him that even if I got to that point it wouldn‚Äôt ever be because of him. I was dealing with a lot of stuff unrelated to him at the time. We stayed together and I forgave him against a lot of peoples advice. im genuinely in love with him and believe in second chances. 

We have other issues that for many people would be a deal breaker. Like at night if he gets too hot he can get physical. We‚Äôve talked about it a lot and he‚Äôs been so much better. I think a lot of maintaining a relationship is knowing your partner what makes them sad happy and even mad. He‚Äôs usually half asleep and doesn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs he‚Äôs being too aggressive. Mostly shoving me over. He‚Äôs also very frugal and cheap with his money, he‚Äôs a full time student and unemployed. my love language is gift giving, so it looks one sided. I‚Äôve vented to our friends about some of these things, even made a few jokes. But our friends are genuinely convinced I‚Äôm in an abusive relationship. Our one friend told me I have stalk-home syndrome. And they make comments occasionally about how unhealthy and toxic our relationship is. A few days ago a trip to Florida to meet an old friend of theirs was brought up, a list of everyone going was talked about and I made a joke saying lol no invite? It was supposed to clearly be a joke because I don‚Äôt even know the person they are going to see and this was the first time I was hearing about it so I thought it would be obvious. One of our friends said no girlfriends allowed. I told my boyfriend about this and he said they are uncomfortable with our relationship. I feel uncomfortable. They think I‚Äôm a victim with genuine stalk-home syndrome. I‚Äôm starting to get a little pissed off. Me and my boyfriend have been at such a great point, I‚Äôm really happy and in love with him. I wanna marry him one day. AITAH?

Comic Book stuff.,AyeDeeHachDee,1,1cjrz1r,high,https://www.reddit.com/r/high/comments/1cjrz1r/comic_book_stuff/,0,"In my life, I've read more DC/VERTIGO books, but I've seen more Marvel Studios films and shows. I don't know even a fraction of the lore of any of the most popular characters, and the little bit of trivial knowledge I do possess is humble. I can see the appeal in the whole superhero genre of entertainment.

I think it's worth noting that the comic book industry continues to tell compelling stories from unique perspectives. The format allows a level of personal artistry that is hard to recapture on the screen. There's always an argument for preserving Art, even at the risk of profit. The irony of what comic book culture has rendered unto the world is not lost on me.

But hey, I'm still a sucker for a lot of this stuff.

My favorite DC character is Superman. My favorite DC film is 'Constantine'. Without thinking, if you asked me what MCU character I'd want to be, I'd say Thor. I'm not sure why, but I kinda felt like I connected with him in 'Endgame'.

I purchased a mattress from Dreams, I was sold a  mattress after going to the store, being scanned by their fancy machine and testing several mattresses I was advised would be optimal for me for at least 5 to 10 minutes each. I eventually decided on a tempur mettress and set up a payment plan and paid a deposit of ¬£100.

The mattress arrived a week later and it‚Äôs absolutely not right for me, it‚Äôs far too firm and makes the issues with my back even worse so I have decided to return it. Looking at the terms and conditions I could not return it right away and had to wait 30 days for the mattress to ‚Äúsettle and conform to my body‚Äù I have not had comfortable sleep in that time. 30 days have now passed and according to their T&C I can only get a refund on the form of store vouchers. This wil be fine if I can find better mattress to my liking from Dreams but if I can‚Äôt find one and whant to shop elsewhere do I have a leg to stand on to actually get my money back? I read somewhere that according to trading standards a shoo cannot enforce store vouchers as refunds but I can‚Äôt find anything in writing that says that. Can anyone confirm this or give me a link to this in writing?

I looked through the consumer rights act and could only see information about refunding digital content.

What stood out for me was that it was not clear from whose view point this story was told. Despite this (or probably because of this), the plot worked well. I read somewhere that the story was told from Messi's (the dog) viewpoint. 

Also, I am surprised that the movie won so many accolades. This is a very intimate story and not as grand as Oppenheimer, Barbie, Maestro, Killers etc. The accolades are deserved though.

how to rule combat,tankbabey,1,1cjrywr,AvatarLegendsTTRPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvatarLegendsTTRPG/comments/1cjrywr/how_to_rule_combat/,0,"so i played a game with some mates over the weekend and it went really well!! a lot of concepts i struggled to wrap my head around just reading about made a lot more sense in play, except for combat. 

i understand the basic flow of combat, choose your action, do the action, note status effects, rinse and repeat. but specifically i had issues with ruling statud effects when the next round of combat starts.

the scenario is the players were running up the beach and trying to get away with a scroll, but fire sage bai was prepared to kill them before he let them or the scroll get away. it turned into combat as they entered the beach and the first exchange went well. the second exchange, i didnt know how to rule a status effect one of the players had gotten, nor did i know how to rule combat when the players were running away and it was onlty bai that was attacking. 

i think i ended up ruling stunned as the player wasnt able to react that round. i also implmented dnd style rounds so we'd know when the status effect wore off. i know that not part of how the gameplay is supposed to work but i couldnt figure out what else to do (we're all dnd players so it made sense to us to rule it that way)

any advice or pointers for next time would be really helpful! i was going off the starter set rules so if somethings about this is mentioned in the core book pls let me know x ",05-04-2024,1,0,Question

It's not a Tsundere...,Silly_Transition_221,1,1cjryw4,100Kanojo,https://i.redd.it/v6e35v708cyc1.jpeg,0,"I have seen some comments and publications that refer to Suu as a tsundere, which is wrong since she does not meet the basic characteristics to be one.

Tsundere comes from ""tsun tsun"" which means ""to turn away in disgust"" and those who make up this stereotype are characterized by having hostile behavior towards the protagonist or person they like but deep down they are sweet people. Tsunderes hide their feelings with aggressive behavior such as insulting or hitting.

If we see Suu we notice that she is not afraid to express what she feels nor hide it, she fearlessly demonstrates her love for Rentarou. He also does not have hostile behavior towards Rentarou, he saved her for her debut when she was not yet his girlfriend, but after starting to date she has not insulted or attacked him in any way.

Although Suu generally appears apathetic, it is not because she hides her feelings, but rather she does not know how to deal with people nor does she know how to function socially, because she has isolated herself from others throughout her life.

In conclusion, Suu is not a tsundere because she does not hide her feelings or act hostile towards the protagonist.",05-04-2024,1,0,Manga Discussion

"How To Break Away From Parents Controlling My Finances?
",Immediate_Being6091,1,1cjryvl,Adulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1cjryvl/how_to_break_away_from_parents_controlling_my/,0,"Hey this is a throwaway account-



My parents work very hard and are wealthy, and they have paid for my rent, tuition, food, prescriptions, my car and all of my insurances. I send them back about $300 every paycheck to help them with costs of keeping me alive. I can't just spend however much I want. They're not crazy rich but they prioritize supporting me. They are constantly telling me they can't afford to support me forever and that I need to be paying them back more each time.



The problem is, I have absolutely no idea how to manage my own finances. Because they pay for those necessities, and then I pay what I can back, I am unable to save up or have any money for myself or my future. I have never been directly responsible for my own savings. And for the record, I cannot afford my cost of living on my own wage by myself.¬†



I'm almost¬†*30*¬†now, and as I begin to make a move across the US for grad school, in an apartment they're paying for, and a tuition my grandparents are paying for.... I'm very worried about not being self sufficient.



Of course I'm so grateful and fortunate that they're willing to support me in such a way. But, its all very hidden and secretive... They don't include me in logistics, the details, the processes for how to manage money. I have no idea how to interact with these economic systems. They just do it all for me. They pay my insurances, my taxes, my rent, my utilities directly. Everything goes over my head. It feels kind of manipulative because I can't go or do anything without them giving consent, as the people who pay all of my bills. They track every purchase. My parents are extremely neurotic and overbearing;¬† I‚Äôm sure they do it with the intent of being helpful and protecting me, but they also absolutely love to hold this control over me, I believe.



When I try to bring it up to them, they say ""oh don't worry, this is temporary, you will be in charge of all of this soon... you'll buy a house, you'll buy a car , you'll be self-sufficient"" , but how is that transition going to actually happen? They shut me up and refuse to show me what‚Äôs going on.





I'm afraid that when they die, I'll just be left without any understanding of finances. And I don't believe I'll ever be able to buy a house or support myself. I have no confidence that I can do that in this economy. But its not just about when they die, its also that I feel like I‚Äôve outgrown this kind of financial control over my life. ¬†I feel like they're super out of touch with the state of the U.S. economy right now, and think getting a house and a well paying job are still accessible. 



Should I just ride this wave as long as I can and let them have control over this huge area of my life? Should I just get over it and be grateful and shut up?¬† Or should I try to change the family-dynamic regarding money somehow? How do I set boundaries around this?



I feel very ashamed about all of this. It feels like they have a disproportionate amount of control of my life.¬†



Anyone have advice or come from a similar situation? Idk what to do.¬†

AITA for having insecurities?,Electrical-Sun-99,1,1cjryus,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cjryus/aita_for_having_insecurities/,0,"I'm (37f) sleeping on the couch after trying to have a talk to my (40m) boyfriend about some insecurities I've had lately. Will try explain it now! 

Anyway we have been together 3 years after both being previously married amd those marriages ending badly. We've had some issues but nothing major and he is a great boyfriend.

A while back he wanted to change his handle on Instagram and I was couldn't explain how to do it so I told him I'd show him. When I had his phone he acted really antsy and couldn't get it off me quick enough. I had never had that vibe off him before and immediately I felt off. I just had this horrible feeling in my stomach. I tried to shake it off but it was still there. I feel like he's been acting more protective of his phone since and I eventually said it to him. He kinda downplayed it (imo) and said there was nothing inappropriate on his phone and he just didn't like anyone having it..that it was a natural reaction.  I ended up dropping the issue cos he treats me so well and I've never had a reason not to trust him. 

But fast forward a few weeks and my insecurities are still there in the background. I've had the urge to pick up his phone on the very limited times he leaves it down unattended and I stop myself cos I do not want to be that person. Anyway in bed tonight it comes spilling out of me. In the past when I felt insecure with exes I tended to pull away and distance myself in the hope they would lavish attention on me and it never worked so I know I need to communicate when I feel down or insecure. But it has backfired on me.

 He basically cannot understand why I still feel insecure and swears he has never sent inappropriate messages and has nothing to hide. I do believe him but I just explained that I was insecure thinking he may be telling women they look well on their IG stories etc. And that I knew it was my issue and I would have to work through it but was just letting him know where my head is at. Anyway he got annoyed with me and defensive and is giving me the cold shoulder. I kissed him goodnight and told him I loved him and got nothing back. So I got up and left the room. I feel that telling him about my insecurities didn't do any good as now he says he wants some space to process it as he cannot believe I'd have any worries/suspicions. And the logical part of me does believe he's a faithful person. I shouldn't have listened to my insecurities but I wanted to be transparent and let him know what was going on in my head. 

So AITA? Should I have shoved those insecurities down and said nothing and hoped id have gotten over it in time? It all feels so childish, I get that. And I hate myself for feeling this way.

Welcome to the Figure 8 subreddit,PhysicsInteresting77,1,1cjryup,figure8,https://www.reddit.com/r/figure8/comments/1cjryup/welcome_to_the_figure_8_subreddit/,0,"# Purpose of the Sub

**Awareness**

My main motivation for creating this sub is to **increase awareness of this body shape**.  Regardless of how active the sub is (or isn't), I'd like it **to serve as a quick-stop for people to discover the shape** (or at least the fact that it has a name and is recognised by at least a few stylists and so forth) **and have resources (see Bookmarks!) for further information on it** to get them started.

I also created this sub out of laziness.  A quick 'Hey I think you might be a r/figure8 like me' is quicker than starting the same conversations and explanations repeatedly.  Even if I've really enjoyed them!  I am lazy.

**Discussion**

If the sub becomes more active I would thoroughly enjoy **participating in discussions around advice for dressing for this body shape**.  And I'll be adding some posts in the near future with some advice from my own experiences and things I've read to get it going.  It's a difficult shape to dress for, especially if you don't know what you're doing or that the shape even is 'known' anywhere.  I think only other 8's really can understand that difficulty.  So let's pool our collective experiences and help each other out!

**Compassion**

Lastly, I would encourage people to discuss their difficulties with some compassion for yourself and for others.  You may hate your body shape but this can be a harsh word to throw around.  Also keep in mind we might have people from all ages viewing content.  Young girls are more prone to developing body issues.  I'd rather see people embracing their body for what it is and celebrating their fashion wins.  Even if we all need to vent sometimes!  Just be mindful of keeping this sub warm and welcoming.",05-04-2024,1,0,

I recently had a migraine that caused vision loss. My peripheral vision was none and I had a rainbow of colors out of my left eye. I'm 35 years old and have never experienced that before. I went to the doctor and blood work was good - ordered MRI. The MRI w/o contrast showed a 5mm white spot on right side (T2, I think is the location). He called me to explain and to order a MRI with contrast which I scheduled for Sunday. He asked if I had any questions but I didn't know what to ask. He said it could be nothing but sounded concerned. 

Can anyone shed any light on this? I don't have any other symptoms (only that one migraine. No headaches, and vision/balance/motor skills are good) and everything else on the MRI was good. I looked online and I just keep seeing MS, which is pretty extreme. 

Not looking for diagnosis, just what are possible reasons outside of it being nothing.

This week on Bah√≠a Nassau street between Camino Real and Tortuga in the Astilleros neighborhood in the city of Veracruz, a Pitbull got out of the house it lives in and attacked and killed another dog in the middle of the street.

Mrs. Josefina Pulido, who witnessed the event, narrated that the facts occurred around 3:00 p.m. when her eight year old daughter was next to the animal that was the victim of the aggression.

""So the truth is that there is great concern because imagine if it attacks my daughter and not the dog, which I mean, it is also a living being"".

After the attack, the owners, who live on the same block, justified the action, arguing that it was ""an animal against another animal"", therefore it was of no importance and they opted to lock themselves in their house.

The neighbors in the area requested the support of the police but they never arrived, so the intervention of the municipal authorities was requested and this Wednesday morning they came and took the Pitbull dog away.

When they complained to the owner he responded aggressively that if they did anything to his pet he would kill one of the family members who reproached him for the act.

""In September last year we were at a children's party and it got loose; it attacked for the third time the dog that it killed today, there were a lot of children at the party in the street, imagine if it had attacked a child"".

Those who live in these streets of the Astilleros neighborhood are frightened that they could be victims of the dog, so they ask the authorities to initiate an investigation and to protect it so that it does not return.

It is important to remember that dog owners are obliged to put them on a leash, breastplate and muzzle -when it is a large or dangerous breed- when taking them out for a walk on the public streets.

This is established both in the Municipal Regulations and in the Animal Protection Law for the State of Veracruz.",05-04-2024,1,0,Animal Fatality(ies) - Pets

I am chronicling every ME character ,beck_wreck,1,1cjryoa,MoriahElizabeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoriahElizabeth/comments/1cjryoa/i_am_chronicling_every_me_character/,0,"A few days ago, I stumbled on a post here asking if anyone has a list of every ME character, and no one did. I thought that was sad, so I started one over at fandom . com. When it's complete, I will add it to any other online wiki pages she has. [Here's the link](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Moriah_Elizabeth). It's a work in progress, but I'm proud of what I've done so far. Many of her characters from 2018 and 2019 are unnamed, so I am doing my best there. 

In the list, I am including the name of the character, the date of their first appearance, the form of art they originated as, the animal they are based off of / combined with, and any addition info, like if they are part of a set, family, etc. 

Not all the info is inputted for the characters I have listed so far, and of course, not all the characters are listed yet I believe if you have a fandom account, you can make your own edits, so I invite everyone to help me out and make this list complete :) 

I don't REALLY have an order made. There is some organization for some of them. For example, her most popular characters were listed first, the blobs and bean bodies are listed together, families are listed together etc. But other than that, there isn't much organization yet, so please, by all means organize if you like. I figured since the table is sortable, I didn't really need to put much effort in organizing it. 

In addition to the table, I also did a pretty big overhaul of all the information on that wiki page. Most notable, I completely redid the ""series"" section. I didn't really do much spell/grammar checking yet, so feel free to edit or let me know of any mistakes you see. 

Hope you guys like what I've got so far :)",05-04-2024,1,0,

After finally fitting my first sff pc together with adult money and second ever custom loop, I turned on my PC for the first time after filling with the pump/fans/rgb all working but no display. After some initial troubleshooting I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do next before draining and disassembling the dang thing. So far I‚Äôve:

1.) reseated the ram several times
2.) tried using one stick of ram in both slots
3.) re-fastened the m.2 storage
4.) double checked and re-connected the 24-pin motherboard power
5.) swapped PCI-E connections to Gpu 90¬∞ adapter
6.) connected the HDMI cable to the motherboard and tried booting
7.) verified that the monitor does in fact still display when plugged into hdmi or display port cables on my prior pc

When I turn on the PSU bottom and then the case the following occurs without variation from any of the previously mentioned trouble shooting.

1.) pc fans, pump, and Rgb light up and idle for a moment
2.) all fans slowly spin up to what I imagine is max RPM
3.) PC stays in this state (longest I‚Äôve waited was 10 mins) and does not automatically restart or turn off

The RGB for my fans is run through the Corsair Fan hub for my fans and connected to a USB 2.0 header, but my cpu waterblock/pump RGB is run through the ARGB header on the MOBO. Pump PWM is also run through the Corsair fan hub. If you have any advice or tips, they would be greatly appreciated as I do not know what to do next here.

I didn't disclosed all this to my parents bcz they are of conservative mindset, Now the problem starts, that guy's mother got cancer even though she got fine but since then that guy's parents forced him to get married, but he kept postponing it bcz he wanted to marry my sis, and my sis was/is preparing for upsc/govt jobs so she cant marry him until she doesn't get any govt job, my sister used to stay tense all day, now 1 day that guy casually pranked my sister that he is getting married and sister burst into tears, it was around 1o clock in night when she came to me crying telling me everything, from the next day she started staying depressed all day.

My parents noticed all this and asked her, then she told everything to them, and they supported her. They consulted with psychiatrist got her proper medication and her condition started to improve. Now my parents started convincing her to leave that guy bcz that guy is from delhi and we are from up, my parents were concerned about it, but my sister refused to leave that guy, she said she will either marry him only or will stay single forever, (I belong to a community where love marriage/ staying single is still a crime), so my parents tried everything they can to convince my sis (even though she is also not wrong completely), so my parents told my sister that they can think about marriage only if she secures a good govt job in that region. Even though they said so but my father still tried to convince her to broke up with him but she refused, and finally stopped talking to my sis and said that he has no relation with her now.

With all such problems my father also fought with my mum and stopped talking to her (even though they are talking now but not too much). My sister started preparing for govt job and she is doing progress, but now she is not doing her best, she spends whole day binge watching some sitcom and studies barely 2-3 hrs. With such actions she is not going to clear any exam and when I tell her to study she just start shouting at me. My once happy family is now broken just bcz of my sister and my father's ego issues.

I am a noobie building a ML app. I am trying to understand how the math/code behind detecting collisions works.

  
So from my understanding, I can train a model to and use **pose estimation** to detect where a person is and his orientation, whilst tracking his key points and coordinates at all times.

  
After I've done this, then I can use **action recognition** to detect and classify what sort of action he/she is performing.

  
What is the next step in this?

  
Let's use this example:

  
**ex1: 2 people in video - their keypoints are both being detected/tracked. both go for a handshake, model recognizes this motioning with the hands from both parties. How do I actually detect a completed handshake? Or the collision of the hands to ensure a handshake is complete.**

  
**ex2: 2 boxers are fighting. all keypoints are detected. boxer1 throws a punch, this gesture is recognized by my system. System counter adds punch landed for this boxer towards his stats. What is the underlying math/logic I must learn to detect that a punch has landed?**

  
**ex3: person is walking in a video. his coordinates are detected. walking gesture is recognized. how to count his number of steps?**

  
Conceptually this is similar to collision detection in video games right? **After pose estimation model + action recognition model + (what is next area of deeplearning/computer vision that addresses this problem)**

I'm sure everyone here has had enough time to test them all! But still gonna do a small review:

- Lawful: You can revive Red Skulled players in exchange for 50 burnt health. Looting a hunter gives 1 bar back. (Secondary comes from Packmule) Gets some ammo from looting hunters.

I've only revive Red Skulled players like 6 times, it doesn't happen too often. However, getting burnt bars back just for looting is awesome because is a common action! Also packmule is pretty good I used to buy it anyway.

- Death: In dark sight you see the soul of monsters and being nearby heals you (Not regen, heal). Monster souls dissipate but hunters are eternal. (Secondary comes from Resilience) You revive mates in half the time.

Is pretty good, if you manage to kill someone near your position as it removes the need to spend med kits on getting depleted bars back. Also, allows to know how many enemies are dead and where they are. I haven't used the secondary much, but it has saved me a couple times. Resilience is a top pick as perk!

- Primal: Double melee damage. (Secondary comes from Beastface) You can step on crows and they will let you pet them, so will every animal.

Too niche for me, aims for a stealth play going through animals and attacking form behind, where enemies expected the sound trap to trigger. The double melee damage is only useful for bosses, most strong melee attacks oneshot anyway. However, I saw a dude 4-tap a boss with a katana, that's pretty scary.

It all happened in Jerez, after a test the previous summer didn‚Äôt go well due to rain.

The 2023 test was seen as an opportunity for the rider to try out the YZR-M1, but also to get some indications of what his performance could be like on a premier class bike. However, there were many problems‚Ä¶ to the point that

The 2021 Superbike World Champion revealed, as quoted by motorsport-total.com, that his requests were not met: ‚ÄòEven before the test, there were discussions about the seating position. Normally, there are three different seats at Yamaha. But when I came for the test, the bike was the same as before. I was just doing my laps. I also didn‚Äôt have many tires available‚Äô.

After the events of the first day of testing, Razgatlioglu spoke with his manager, Kenan Sofuoglu, and didn‚Äôt want to return for the second day. However, respect for Yamaha prevailed.

Despite the less-than-ideal experience with the Yamaha MotoGP bike, the current ROKiT BMW rider still feels grateful and privileged: ‚ÄòEvery young rider has a dream. They want to ride a MotoGP bike at some point. I was able to have that experience, which makes me very happy‚Äô. ‚Äú

My personal comments;  The facts about Toprak‚Äôs motogp tests with M1 have been revealed after Toprak left Yamaha. 

Honestly, this is what i already knew. Yamaha didn‚Äôt suprise. From the beginning, Yamaha didn‚Äôt want Toprak to join motogp. It might be about sponsorship issue, dont know what they had in their mind. Therefore they didn‚Äôt give him a proper chance. They did everything to slow down him resulting in that he couldn‚Äôt show his maximum performance. In my opinion The test was totally unfair and affected Toprak‚Äôs reputation. But the people in the sport are aware of what‚Äôs going on and what Toprak can do. 

One last note that; As soon as Toprak joined BMW , Bmw factory prepared 3 different bikes with 3 different seat positions for Toprak and all options were available in the 1st test of Toprak. As This is crucial for Toprak to feel comfortable and it is a must for toprak, they immediately did this. Because if your rider doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable, he can‚Äôt perform well. ",05-04-2024,1,0,

"Breeze Can Be a Frustrating Experience
",Automatic_Sea_4729,1,1cjryec,VALORANT,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1cjryec/breeze_can_be_a_frustrating_experience/,0,"As an avid player i enjoy most maps. However, there's one map that continues to test my patience and frustrate me to no end: Breeze. 

**Size**: Breeze is massive. Its sprawling layout and wide-open spaces make it difficult to control and navigate, especially when compared to the more compact maps like Bind or Haven. This size imbalance can lead to situations where teams struggle to coordinate and effectively cover key areas, resulting in chaotic gameplay and frustrating losses.

 **Long Sightlines**: The abundance of long sightlines on Breeze heavily favors operators and long-range rifles, making it challenging for players who prefer close-quarters combat or aggressive playstyles. This can create a stagnant and one-dimensional gameplay experience, where matches devolve into tedious sniper battles that lack the dynamic action and excitement found on other maps.

 **Limited Strategic Depth**: Despite its size, Breeze offers limited strategic depth compared to other Valorant maps. The lack of intricate pathways and tight chokepoints reduces the potential for strategic flanks and creative plays, leading to repetitive and predictable gameplay scenarios. This can make matches on Breeze feel formulaic and uninspired, leaving players yearning for the strategic depth and versatility found on maps like Split or Ascent.

**Verticality Woes**: While verticality can add an interesting dynamic to gameplay, Breeze's implementation of it feels clunky and unrefined. Navigating the various elevated platforms and vertical angles often feels awkward and unintuitive, leading to frustrating moments of disorientation and vulnerability. Additionally, the lack of clear visual cues and map indicators can make it difficult for players to effectively utilize verticality to their advantage, further exacerbating the map's shortcomings.

While Breeze may offer a picturesque tropical setting, it falls short in providing the engaging and balanced gameplay experience that Valorant is known for. Its oversized layout, long sightlines, lack of strategic depth, and awkward verticality make it a frustrating and often unrewarding map to play on. As a dedicated Valorant player, I hope to see improvements made to Breeze in the future to address these issues and bring it more in line with the high standards set by the game's other maps.",05-04-2024,1,0,Discussion

If the government or society hates homeless people that badly (as in if people are THAT cruel to homeless individuals to just getting rid of them via genocide.), wouldn't that mean they have already enforced draconian policies akin to the holocaust, meaning that anybody who is homeless would've been rounded up then sent to a facility indifferent to a concentration camp awaiting what is going to happen to them, meaning that genocide is already being committed.",05-04-2024,1,0,

Five years and multiple doctors, I‚Äôve been hearing, well, we‚Äôll see how it is in 6 months‚Ä¶ or well, we all have issues, or well, I‚Äôm sure you can get through it. 

I finally got a new doctor when I moved, and six months later (stupid referrals take forever), I‚Äôve now been through the mental health clinic testing and evaluation, and WHAT DO YOU FUCKING KNOW‚Ä¶ I have ADHD and CPTSD.  You think!? I know I‚Äôm a woman and we get dismissed a lot, but geez. This was such an insane amount of gaslighting. 

So now, I wait to start therapy for the PTSD and to talk to my GP for meds (the mental health group doesn‚Äôt prescribe them). At least there‚Äôs a diagnosis and a light now. 

Keep being persistent, y‚Äôall. Be the squeaky wheel. Pitch fits. Whatever it takes to get someone to listen.

apparate, apparated, apparation

vs. 

Apparition, according to dictionaries: a vision,
a supernatural appearance of a person or thing, especially a ghost; a specter or phantom; wraith:
a ghostly apparition at midnight.

I know that a wiki says Apparition, but that likely came from the uncorrected typo in the books.

Advice for pregnancy and postpartum ,Interesting_Fee_6698,1,1cjry2u,EthicalNonMonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1cjry2u/advice_for_pregnancy_and_postpartum/,1,"I (31F)  am in an ENM marriage and currently 15 weeks pregnant (with my husband, 30M). Our dynamic is hierarchical - we've been together for 9 years and open for about 1 (we've had bouts of ""openness"" in the past but not very ethical then, so definitely keen to do it better this time!). 

 We both have partners that we date separately (and one that we date together). All our partners know about the pregnancy & we‚Äôve been very transparent about taking a break from ENM at some point because of it. This is my first pregnancy so not something that we know how to navigate. I am in therapy and working through it there but would really appreciate some advice here too, particularly from other people who have experienced pregnancy. 

My husband has said that he will take a break from seeing his partners when I‚Äôm also ready to stop dating. I assumed I‚Äôll keep dating until around 20 weeks, but found that my self-confidence and sex drive (and drive to do anything other than sleep on the couch) has been 0, so I haven‚Äôt been almost at all (I also haven‚Äôt been dating my husband much either!). He‚Äôs still dating others and I‚Äôm very encouraging of it (as I don‚Äôt want to be controlling / demand that he stops because I have). I have a date planned for next week (with an existing partner) and I noticed that I don‚Äôt think my motivation is in the right place (ie not sure if I‚Äôm actually keen to go on a date or doing it for the sake of it & so that my husband doesn‚Äôt feel bad that I‚Äôm not dating and he is - which obviously wouldn‚Äôt be an ethical reason to do it). 

Does anyone have any advice for ethical ways to take a break from ENM for the remainder of the pregnancy and postpartum (until we feel ready - no idea how long this would take!)? I don't want our partners to feel disposable, so we will definitely still be in touch with them.  ",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice needed
Insights from Microsoft Copilot!,Shoobedowop,1,1cjry2o,LAClippers,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAClippers/comments/1cjry2o/insights_from_microsoft_copilot/,1,"The Los Angeles Clippers face an intriguing offseason after their first-round exit in the playoffs. Let's break down some key considerations for their offseason moves:

1. **Paul George's Free Agency**:
   - Paul George is the top unrestricted free agent for the Clippers. While many believe he'll want to remain in Los Angeles, there are factors to consider.
   - The Clippers want to retain George as a foundational piece, but extension talks broke down earlier this season. They hoped he'd take less than a max contract, but he's expected to command significant interest on the free agent market.
   - The Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic have been linked to George. The Sixers envision a trio of Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and George, while Orlando seeks outside shooting and veteran presence‚Å¥.

2. **James Harden's Situation**:
   - James Harden, who joined the Clippers, will also enter unrestricted free agency. His desire to play for the Clippers has been reported, but there's uncertainty.
   - The Clippers need to decide whether to pursue Harden aggressively or explore other options. His fit alongside George and Leonard will be crucial.

3. **Coaching and Front Office**:
   - Coach Ty Lue and executive Lawrence Frank's futures are topics of discussion. The organization must evaluate their performance and decide whether to retain them.
   - The front office should assess the roster and make necessary adjustments. This includes evaluating role players, addressing depth, and potentially making trades.

4. **Trade Market and Roster Adjustments**:
   - The Clippers can explore the trade market to improve their roster. They've been trying to trade Marcus Morris and Norman Powell.
   - Harden's desire to join the Clippers from the 76ers adds another layer. The team must weigh the potential impact of such a move‚Å∂.

In summary, the Clippers need to navigate George's free agency, consider Harden's fit, evaluate coaching and front office decisions, and explore trade opportunities. Their offseason moves will shape their championship aspirations for the upcoming season‚Å¥. üèÄüåü

I recently bought a 2000 IS200 and hopefully a life of luxury has begun.

I bought this off a friend and he had it sitting in the driveway for around 6 months. I've noticed that it has unusually bad fuel economy. I've driven a bridgeported Weber 13B RX7 in the past so this is saying something. I haven't calculated it yet but I can literally see the fuel needle going down when I just drive to the shops. I'm guessing this has something to do with it being left standing and not being taken care of.

It's also idling very rough on startup (shakes and engine stalls) and before it warms up. Over idle rpms it drives absolutely fine, took it on a mountain trip for 4 hours and it was very smooth.

The oil and coolant look fine and have apparently been changed recently, next step is replacing the oil filter which looks like a pain! What other first steps should I take to address the issue? I've heard I should be looking at cleaning the injectors.

Dua Lipa‚Äôs Radical Optimism Is Overly Sanitized - Album Review,RedHeadReviews,1,1cjrxx1,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1cjrxx1/dua_lipas_radical_optimism_is_overly_sanitized/,0,"Ahead of the release of *Radical Optimism*, Dua Lipa pitched her third album as a ‚Äúpsychedelic-pop-infused tribute to U.K rave culture,‚Äù citing Primal Scream and Massive Attack as two major influences. It‚Äôs difficult to catch the parallels. Yes, this is a pop album, by a UK artist, that contains modest psychedelic notes due to the involvement of Kevin Parker, but anyone expecting to hear something as deliciously serrated as *Higher Than the Sun* will be sorely disappointed. This doesn‚Äôt in any way resemble the former groups‚Äô brash, fragmented approach to beat making, nor the latter‚Äôs brand of richly detailed trip-hop. It‚Äôs exactly the sort of album you‚Äôd expect Lipa to make; a breezy batch of dance-pop songs. 

Novelty isn‚Äôt a strict requirement for a great album Dua Lipa album anyway. With *Future Nostalgia*, the singer catapulted herself into contention for queen of the dance floor with a set of radiant, straightforward retro-pop songs. *Radical Optimism* follows a similar blueprint, this time switching glamorous 80s disco for controlled synth-pop, but fails to recapture the snapiness and alluring glow of its predecessor. 

There‚Äôs just a lot *less* going on here, in every facet. Lipa‚Äôs writing, in particular, lacks the sort of specificity that endears listeners to a story and its characters. Lipa has never been the sort of pop star to allow intimate details from her private life to get tangled with her professional one, but she explores the concept of love with such a lack of sentimentality it‚Äôs as if she‚Äôs only ever read about the emotion before, yet to experience it. On *End Of An Era*, the protagonist confesses to dreaming of staying together forever with a man she‚Äôs only just exchanged ‚ÄúHey‚Äôs‚Äù with (because the rhyme just works so damn well!). Six tracks later, on *Illusion*, though, Lipa starts preaching about her new-found emotional maturity and how she won‚Äôt allow the manipulator she‚Äôs spotted from a mile away to keep her from dancing. These are all clich√©s the singer has burnt through before and her refusal to bolster these themes with more poignant writing renders each scenario trivial.

The expressive gestures are similarly stifled in her singing. Lipa is a loud presence on *Radical Optimism*, however, she isn‚Äôt a particularly evocative one. There are plenty of stadium-sized choruses, and Lipa spends most of the album belting her words out, but it‚Äôs not enough to distract you from her overly sanitized singing. Though impressive from a technical standpoint, the stainless chants on *Houdini* have little dramatic emphasis behind them. Lipa employs a wide array of textures and tricks on *Whatcha Doing*. Among them are unsavoury, Ariana Grande-style whistle notes and grating digitized lilts that push Lipa‚Äôs voice further into the realm of anonymity. For the most part, the singing is serviceable, though the performances do lack conviction and shine, crucial elements that established Lipa as a theatrical entertainer on *Future Nostalgia*.

The beats hit harder than any of the singer‚Äôs melodies. Although Lipa‚Äôs credentials as an undeniable superstar may be muffled here, Kevin Parker and Danny L Harle become more comfortable with their roles as reliable pop producers. Both artists' appreciation for the eccentric trickle into the album, their contributions injecting *Radical Optimism* with the brightness its title promises. What Parker brings to the equation is effortlessly airy basslines that act as the motor for the album. His compositional skills are front and centre on *Whatcha Doing* and *Houdini*, songs where his input provides the stability and pep that Lipa can‚Äôt. Harle assists with the album‚Äôs more ornate pockets, dousing these songs with delicious shimmering effects. The brief moment of glitchy mania that follows the bridge on *Illusion* is a thrilling musical puzzle that has his fingerprints all over it. 

All the best moments of *Radical Optimism* coincide with points where the beat architects are given license to take control. To be clear, none of the main cast are operating at the peak of their powers here, but Parker and Harle are at least close. Lipa can‚Äôt compete with the colour that they contribute. She seems a little complacent, more interested in being just another faceless figure on the dancefloor rather than leaving her own unique print on dance music.

I‚Äôm really upset with my bank. I started a new business and the equipment I plan to buy costs $200k. It has a useful life of 5 years before it will fully depreciate.

I asked my bank what the best loan they could give me so that I did not have to spend the $200k in my account. I figure, in case I need extra capital to bolster the company during the first few month id rather have got a loan upfro than applying for one when I may really need it. 

The bank offered to invest the funds in a 5 year cd that pays 4.5% currently and charge me 2% on top of that in interest. The cd ould be the collateral for the loan. 

I don‚Äôt need the loan, I look at it as more of a safety net. So I went to the bank and I said the Mid-term IRS AFR Rates for May 24 are 4.42% on a 3-9 year loan. I want the bank to put my $200k in the cd and pay me part of the 8 points between the age and cd rate. 

I didn‚Äôt have any expectation of getting a negative rate loan. I just wanted to pay 1% instead of 2%

The more I think about it why shouldn‚Äôt they or why can‚Äôt the bank give me a few points of the cd/tbill/ whatever the investment vehicle is if it is above the minimum the irs requires to tax the lender on?

\* JWOWW vs Angelina‚Äôs full-blown war over JWOWW‚Äôs fianc√© ‚Äò24‚Äô getting handsy with Angelina in Las Vegas (which lead to JWOWW and Angelina almost hitting each other with wine bottles as they fought around the dinner table).

\* Angelina‚Äôs very messy divorce with Chris - including Chris later exposing to Mike that Angelina was in fact the one who leaked the wedding speech video footage to the media.

\* Angelina vs Nikki wine throwing fight - and Pauly literally smashing in the door to get into the room they were fighting in where Nikki was showering Angelina with red wine.

\* And now Angelina‚Äôs war with Sammi. The mess that we all witnessed on Thursday night was classic messy reality TV and reminded me of OG Jersey Shore and¬†**I LOVED IT!!!**

Life journal ,DiosMommyMilkers,1,1cjrxs5,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cjrxs5/life_journal/,1,"My therapist recommended I start a journal or blog to document how I‚Äôve been feeling about stuff (she probably didn‚Äôt mean on Reddit, but it‚Äôs what I feel would be easiest for me) 

I guess I‚Äôll start with introductory stuff, I‚Äôm a sophomore trans girl in highschool, I currently have a loving girlfriend (Freshmen at my school) who I met through an extracurricular choir group. 

Most of my problems stem from one point of origin. Last year i was dating a girl i also met from this choir. She was super nice in the moment, but her mom never liked me. That was fine i guess, never really directly impacted either of us. We broke up once because her mom convinced her to, and I (now regretfully) convinced her that she can have her own opinions separate from her mom. 

Flash forward to last October and our choir was hosting an event where we bring it younger kids to teach some holloween songs and dance, and we get seperate kids to teach, she gets two little girls (maybe 3rd grade) and i get a super little boy who was in 1st grade. This kid was a lot for me to handle alone so i asked one of our floaters (people without specific jobs) to help me teach him for the day. 

In the process i got closer with this helper (my now girlfriend). We talked with the kid all day about what his favorite song is, his favorite foods, typically stuff you‚Äôd ask a kid. But the day after, my at the time girlfriend gets mad at me. She doesn‚Äôt tell me why at first but i later get told it‚Äôs because i was hanging out with this other girl.

I guess i could kinda see where she was coming from, but i was just doing my job and teaching this kid.

A lot of on and off fighting goes on,and she finally just breaks up with me. But here‚Äôs where things have started getting bad for me. She claimed I SA‚Äôed her and forced myself on her (the only time we did anything remotely intimate was her idea), and she proceeded to tell the entire sophomore class that i forced her to send nsfw pictures (they were sent to me completely unsolicited)

Now i go around school getting called a tr*ny and a r*pist. I‚Äôve even had a police officer called to my classroom to check my phone for saved nsfw pictures of her. 

I just wish i had a way to prove my innocence, but she‚Äôs masterful crafted her argument where i can‚Äôt prove or disprove anything. 

If any of you have questions, words of wisdom, or thoughts, I‚Äôd love to respond to anything that you have to say. 

I love you all, and have a good day or night ‚ù§Ô∏è",05-04-2024,1,0,Serious

How often do they send surveys and other emails and do they take a decent time to complete.

Weird husky ear thing,Sea_Object_6764,1,1cjrxpn,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1cjrxpn/weird_husky_ear_thing/,1,"Hi. Husky mom here.

Preface: I adopted my girl at 1.5 years old, she's 4 now so I have no medical records prior to me adopting her from the rescue.

Long story short... she flicks one of her ears constantly and then it sits at a weird angle/cocked to the side/droopy.

I‚Äôve seen it happen randomly- when she plays hard or runs too fast, sometimes if there's a loud noise, sometimes just jumping up and down for a treat- it's enough that it's concerned me. 

I've taken her to multiple vets who have all told me her ears are ""perfect."" I've gotten her a MRI scan of her brain and neck at a specialty dog neurologist. Nothing out of the ordinary and no abnormalities, no signs of seizures. After another vet visit this last week- and another clean bill of health- My primary vet gave me ear cleaner for her. She HATES it. She is the sweetest and most gentle little girl, and tonight she bit my husband when he was doing it because she was so scared. If she sees the bottle, she bolts.

My heart breaks when I see her beautiful face with one upright ear and the other cocked to the side or droopy. I don't care about the aesthetics, I care about whether or not she's uncomfortable. I wish she could talk. Have you seen or experienced something like this? She has seen a dog neurologist, and even he said he doesn't see anything. I also wish I knew what happened to her before us. I wish I knew if it was trauma as a puppy, if she has a weird tick. Can dogs even get those? Would a micro seizure show up on her MRI? I‚Äôve googled and dug myself into a giant hole that I feel like is collapsing over my head. 

Other than the ear thing a few times a week, she‚Äôs a happy loving little girl. She eats, loves treats, loves walks and car rides‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm lost.",05-04-2024,1,0,

This is part of my slow start in selling most of the parts/optics/accessories I've accumulated over the past 6 months before my wife kills me and you see all of this in an estate sale.  I've tried my best to find good deals and bargain hunt, so I'm just trying to pass those along and recoup most of the money.  Prices are shipped.

Today I have a few nicer things to sell:

16"" CMT/sionics/FCD upper,  <100 rounds, small ding on shell deflector, otherwise excellent condition. $525 shipped/ insured

CMT UPUR 2 upper
Sionics medium contour midlength 16"" barrel
FCD RHF 13.7""
FCD Gas block and BRT 50/50 mid length tube .076"" (.073"" for other tubes - see BRT website)
FCD 6315KM shimmed with Precision Armament washer

NIB 18"" odin works 6.5 grendel barrel with gas block and tube - $140

PA Slx 1-6x24 sfp scope with illuminated ACSS reticle.  This is a catch and release that's been sitting in my safe.  Was mounted and rattlecanned by previous owner.  Has not seen any rounds.  - $210

3 NIP armalite ar10B mags, 7.62/.308 - $65 

Checkmate m1a 10 round mag - $20

556 mag bundle: 3 hex mag carbon fiber 30 rounders and 1 okay industries surplus 30 rounder - $35

New Aero AGB's: .625, .875 - $50 each

BFG vickers sling with 1 push button qd, 1 RED (rapid emergency detachment) + burned socket.  - $75

Last up is a curved larue MBT2S, NIB, that I WTT for a flat bow mbt2s.  An older, skeletonized version in new/like new condition would be ideal and I could throw in a decent mag for one of those.

since baby boomers is more or less retired as a cohort. 

gen x are at the higher management of companies as senior management so they're pretty red circled until they retire

gen z is young they can adapt 

gen alpha they're growing up under this they'll be fine

but millennials  unless you are already in the tech field or as a engineer or shall we say very bright, right now a lot of millennials (age 28-44) are pretty much caught with their pants down in the sense they were born into the 3rd industrial revolution 

**a period of technological advancements that began in the late 20th century and continues to the present day**. This period is characterized by the rise of digital technology, automation, and the internet.  so basically computers, smart phones, internet etc. 

we saw in history in the 1980s/early 1990s the hell that the younger silent gen had to go through with the 3rd industrial revolution and they were urged to get job retraining and a lot of the silent gen folks said the job retraining was basicallly bs it would take too much to get caught up to the point of making it not worth it in the first place.  

so my primary question after my set up is do you think millennials will get crushed by the 4th industrial revolution?

Reddit Buzz: NIO's Technical and Fundamental Analysis Unveiled üìàüîç Will The Electric Vehicle Giant Excel in 2024?,stockinvest-us,1,1cjrxgx,StockInvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockInvest/comments/1cjrxgx/reddit_buzz_nios_technical_and_fundamental/,0,"üöÄ Unlock Exclusive Insights on NIO: Get deeper analysis and expert views on NIO's latest market trends before you read on. [Click Here to Dive In](https://stockinvest.us/stock/NIO?sref=reddit) üåü

**Technical Analysis**



NIO's immediate technical indicators provide a mixed view of its short-term trajectory. As of the last trading session on May 03, 2024, the stock closed at $5.57, which is just below the resistance level at $5.59 and above the support at $5.48. This suggests a consolidation phase around this price range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 86 indicates that the stock is currently in overbought territory, which could lead to a potential pullback or side-ways movement in the short term. 



The stock's price is significantly below the 200 Day Moving Average (DMA) of $7.80, highlighting a long-term bearish trend. However, it is above the 50 DMA of $4.94, suggesting some short-term bullish sentiment. The MACD, being negative, confirms a bearish signal over the past few months. 



**Fundamental Analysis**



NIO Inc. reported a substantial year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for April 2024, with an impressive 134.6% rise. This improvement in deliveries, especially in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, indicates robust demand and operational execution. However, the financial health of the company reflects challenges, as indicated by the negative earnings per share (EPS) of -$1.72 and a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of -3.24. 



Despite the negative earnings, analyst consensus from various brokerage firms leans towards a 'Buy', with target price estimates averaging around $28.72, far above the current trading price. This discrepancy suggests that analysts might be seeing long-term potential that is currently not reflected in the day-to-day price movements. 



**Intrinsic Value and Investment Potential**



NIO‚Äôs market capitalization stands at approximately $8.74 billion, which is relatively small considering the potential growth in the electric vehicle sector, especially in China. The company's sales growth, driven by increased deliveries, indicates a strong market demand which might not yet be fully valued in the current market price. Regarding long-term potential, NIO could be undervalued given its strategic position in a rapidly expanding sector and improving delivery numbers. However, the company's profitability concerns, reflected in its negative EPS and PE ratio, could be a significant risk for potential investors. 



**Short and Long-Term Predictions**



For the next trading day on May 06, 2024, considering the high RSI and proximity to the resistance level, a slight pullback or stabilized trading around the current price level might be expected. Over the upcoming week, if the stock maintains support above $5.48 and does not push significantly past the resistance at $5.59, more consolidation around the current levels could be anticipated. 



**Overall Evaluation**



Taking into account NIO‚Äôs growing vehicle deliveries, strategic market positioning, and current technical setup, the stock aligns more as a 'Hold' for short-term traders due to overbought conditions and possible upcoming price stabilization. For long-term investors, considering the substantial projected targets and growth potential in a key sector, categorizing it as a 'Buy' might be justified, focusing on the potential for appreciation once market sentiment aligns better with the company‚Äôs operational achievements and sector prospects. 



This conclusion takes into account current overbought conditions that may lead to short-term price a [...]

Cat health question ,Altruistic-Squash186,1,1cjrxga,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1cjrxga/cat_health_question/,1,"For a while now both of my cars have been periodically scratching their ears followed by a head shake. One cat has it worse than the other. But it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre doing it every minute. Sounds like ear mites or an ear infection, but none of them have any other symptoms like bad smell or some sort of a discharge/wax buildup (both cats‚Äô ears are clean). My next bet is some sort of allergic reaction, but how plausible is it they both have the same allergic reaction to something? 

Another thing worth mentioning is that the cat that has it worse also has a chronic cough whose origin is also unclear. 

The vet has not been able to come up with anything and Google says either ear mites or infection which also doesn‚Äôt really fit (no discharge, no red inflamed ears, no bad odor).

Anyone experience anything similar with their cat?

"Old car totaled, what direction to go next?

I hit a deer and it crunched enough different body panels and headlights that insurance doesn't want to bother. It was fully paid off, so I have the option to take $25K and hand over the title, or take the car back plus $19K and try and get it fixed and get a salvage title. 

Assuming I take the full $25K value, there are a lot of options for us on the table for a new car. 

We have solar panels and a 240V outlet installed already for full electric or PHEV options. Our other car is a beater ICE Hyundai Sonata, which is fine as a second car. Eventually, we would like to have one BEV and one ICE, hybrid, or PHEV as our two cars. The BEV for around town/daily and a bigger SUV for longer road trips. 

For the SUV, we want something similar in size, safety, and functionality to the XC90. 3rd row w/ 6-7 seats. Price range up to $75K. Car will primarily be used for local driving (trips under 30mi). In winter, we go to the mountains every weekend (60mi each way). I do a winter tire swap every year, and would prefer AWD. 2-3 times a year we go on a longer road trip that's a hundred miles or more each way (usually a ski trip in the winter and 2 or more camping road trips in the summer). Location is Seattle, WA, so weather does not get extremely hot or cold. 

Options I'm thinking about. 

1. Get a ICE or PHEV SUV now that is good for those longer trips. A PHEV XC90 seems ideal. They look great and we loved our old one (despite high cost of maintenance). Plus I can keep using my accessories and winter rims and tires with it. Then wait to figure out a fully electric car to get after our Hyundai dies. 

2. Get a BEV now that gets us back to 2 cars, then wait on more/better options for 3rd row SUVs. This could be any class/model and would primarily for driving around town and shuttling around family.

3. Get a BEV 3rd row SUV with lots of range that can do it all. Kia EV9? EX90? R1S? Only issue I see here is that a lot of these cars aren't available yet or might have big markups.

Looking for any advice and input. Despite the higher price range, I'm still looking for a good deal.",05-04-2024,1,0,

1. Are there any boat rentals open this early? Most I'm seeing say mid to late May. One of our group strongly prefers canoes to kayaks, but honestly I'd take a SUP if that's what it takes to get out on the water.

2. Is it safe to go out this early in the season? There's talk of maybe taking inflatable kayaks, but we want to make sure that would be safe. Most of our experience is on southern lakes and swamps, so there's probably a very different set of hazards here which we don't even know to ask about.

Szeth used it fairly extensively in that battle, cleaving a thunderclast in two, and vaporizing a ton of soldiers and I think some fused too, although I can't specifically recall how many fused. Due to how Nightblood works, cutting through all three realms and absorbing investiture, the fused he killed should be perma dead right? The thunderclast too. On my current reread I feel like this doesn't really get addressed or acknowledged for how significant it is. A large part of RoW is about discovering a way to permanently kill the opposing side. And one side already has a way of doing this.

Now, the humans could very well not realize the importance of how Nightblood kills, in fact I wouldn't expect them to figure that out without some help. They have no way of knowing that a fused has been taken out of the cycle and perma killed.

But the fused clearly saw how dangerous the sword was, and they would have realized pretty quickly that anyone who touched Nightblood wasn't reborn in the next storm. Particularly the Thunderclast, as I don't think there are very many of them and each one is a pretty high ranking spren. Yet in the Venli viewpoints in RoW we see multiple meetings among the leaders of the singers, and they never mention (I think) the danger posed by the back sword or the fact that some of their number have been perma killed. At the very least you would think Odium would be extremely wary of Nightblood and would have passed hat along to his leaders among the singers. This should be the first time ANY fused has died permanently.

Is there something I'm missing here? Does Nightblood not take them out of the cycle somehow? Any other thoughts?",05-04-2024,1,0,Rhythm of War

we have our own separate beds and the room is average to small. we have a curtain that goes down the middle to act as a ‚Äúwall‚Äù so obviously i cant see what hes doing unless i go on his side

sometimes when im just chilling on my bed my brother gets all quiet and i start hearing like rustling under his bed sheets. i dont even wanna imagine what i feel like hes doing cause its really weird to think about. i just put in my earphones cause what the fuck am i supposed to do

i just dont know what to do and im broke since im in college so i cant really get my own apartment right now. i desperately want to move out cause im already sick of having to deal with my mom but its gonna take some time ",05-04-2024,1,0,

No heating/hot water ,Doghandler157,1,1cjrxby,TenantsInTheUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1cjrxby/no_heatinghot_water/,0,"I‚Äôm a tenant (obviously lol), landlord sent someone out to service the boiler at the end of March. 
About a week and a half later, my heating went. A day later, so did the hot water. A plumber was sent out, he reset the boiler and told me it should be okay now. 
Same thing happened again. Letting agent came out to have a look, advised I changed the batteries in the control panel and keep them updated if anything changed. 
Same thing happened again. Sent the plumber back out and he advised it needed a new control panel, and there may be an issue with a valve etc. I also had a leak in the water tank for the emersion. 
Boiler worked sporadically, sometimes just heating, sometimes water, sometimes both. Brought this up to the letting agent who said they‚Äôd speak to the landlord. 

Wednesday night, it went again. Let the letting agents know asap, they said they‚Äôd send a plumber out. 
Thursday, I went into the kitchen where the boiler is and it smelt strongly of gas. Tried calling letting agent, no answer. Called out gas safety folks, who said the boiler is leaking neat gas and could have blown up. Capped it off and went on his way. 
Yesterday, letting agent responded and sent a plumber out who has condemned the boiler. I asked him to check the leak his colleague had noticed on the emersion before he went so I knew that was safe to use, low and behold, it‚Äôs not working. Rang letting agent back and told them, landlord was arguing point blank it worked, I invited them to come and look themselves. They conceded I may be right and sent an electrician out. Heating fuse has gone, and he can‚Äôt fix it. 

I‚Äôve been told landlord wants another two quotes alongside the original plumber that condemned the boiler, one is being done on Tuesday, the other on Thursday. In all likelihood it will be next Friday before any work will be done in a best case scenario. That will put me at over a week of not being able to shower or heat my home (fortunately it‚Äôs fairly mild where I am at the minute). 

I‚Äôve offered to call around local companies for quotes, that was refused. Landlord will only use one of two local companies or British Gas. If I‚Äôm being totally honest, I just don‚Äôt think they want to pay someone on a bank holiday to come out. 

I‚Äôm absolutely stumped as to where to go from here. I‚Äôm not from the area, closest friend/family member is a two hour drive, which I unfortunately can‚Äôt do at the minute as I‚Äôm working. Everything is closed with it being bank holiday, other than driving to a service station I can‚Äôt get a shower, I‚Äôm out of luck. I‚Äôm also skint, my vehicle has cost me a fortune this month and I‚Äôm a week off payday. 

Any advice on the next steps I can take?
 
I‚Äôve left the letting agent a text and I‚Äôm going to try and call them when they open, but I doubt anyone will be there. 
I live alone, and I‚Äôm considered vulnerable due to my disabilities. I hate to pester, and I really don‚Äôt want to come across rude, but I‚Äôm seething. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice Required

I was on antidepressants for 20 years and spent 5 years tapering off. During the slow taper I experienced burning skin sensations and diarrhea and first brought it up to a doctor about 7-8 years ago. In the withdrawal forums people mentioned these symptoms so I figured it was a normal response while coming off an SNRI and mirtazapine, the latter which can really mess people up with cramping and diarrhea. The intermittent diarrhea continues, going from normal to constipated to loose. I‚Äôm chicken so hadn‚Äôt done a true colonoscopy, opting for Cologuard stool tests because there‚Äôs no history of colon cancer in my family.

A few years ago an integrative care PA treated me with an antifungal, presuming my intestinal issues were yeast overgrowth. Helped for awhile but didn‚Äôt last.

I‚Äôd been bulimic for a lot of years and sometime in 2010 I woke with severe right side sharp pain. Rather than shamefully go to a doctor, I thought I had done damage to myself and quit the purging for good.

I later learned that a cousin had her gallbladder out - she is a half sister of sorts since our moms were identical twins. I continued to have right side spasms once in a while. Denial. Ignored it.

I went through menopausal hot flashes but they were more of the sweaty version, not full red flushes. I am currently on HRT.

Sometime last year I woke to severe right side pain that almost sent me to the hospital but it passed in about 5 minutes.

Around Christmas it happened again and wouldn‚Äôt stop. Ambulance to the ER-bad, but fentanyl knocked the pain down. CT scan showed no gall stones or kidney stones. Liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas normal but mild diverticulosis. I figured the diverticulosis was the cause of the intermittent diarrhea. Just deal with it. I should have stayed for a HIDA but was there all day and wanted to get home, intended to do it at an outside place, but life marched on‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt remember when, maybe three months ago I had the first severe flushing episode at work. My boss came into the office and I get embarrassed around him - next thing I know my skin is burning and my face and neck are brick red, spread down to my hands! Took Benadyl but it took more than an hour to subside.

I was also waking to a hot flashy heat at night but attributed it to my HRT timing not being right.

Two days ago I ate the rest of a Thai chicken peanut bowl for lunch that I started the day before with no issues. I went outside for something and felt the flush coming on, same as last time. I purposely vomited lunch for fear the food was the cause. I was due at work but called in to say I was delayed. I looked so hideous, I couldn‚Äôt go in like that. When I did go in the redness was much reduced but still present. 

I took my BP and it was elevated for me, 128/75 or close to it. I oddly usually run low, sometimes 98/65 or such.

During covid I got a pulse oximeter and discovered that my resting pulse is often high, in the 90‚Äôs, but never like that at my doc appointments.

I‚Äôve had niggly sensations in my right side lately.

I researched severe facial flushing and stumbled upon carcinoid syndrome and proceeded to freak out. 

Never in my life have I experienced flushing to that degree, but once: I ate fish at a restaurant that triggered severe flushing, probably not stored properly- almost 30 years ago.

I can‚Äôt get in to my doctor for 3 weeks. I‚Äôm afraid he will poo-poo my fear and waste time chasing other prospects first. I will go armed with the three tests.

What does the 24 hr urine testing entail? Can urine be collected on a Sunday and returned the next morning?

I‚Äôm on a state medicare plan and am afraid they won‚Äôt authorize testing. We used to have financial security but my husband was laid off and we both work low wage jobs now. If I can‚Äôt work we can‚Äôt cover monthly expenses on his income and I fear losing our house and savings. I know I‚Äôm jumping the gun catastrophizing.",05-04-2024,1,0,

Kiran Rao's second directorial venture following ""Dhobi Ghat"" (2011), has garnered attention through screenings at various global film festivals. Set in a rural Indian village, it delves into the depths of patriarchy in the Hindi heartland, set in the fictional Nirmal Pradesh. Through subtle storytelling, it exposes gender discrimination and the invisibility of women without resorting to sloganeering, offering a perceptive glimpse into societal injustices.



Reflecting the rural satire, the film's music, curated by Ram Sampath, blends earthy tones with comedic elements. With contributions from Prashant Pandey, Divyanidhi Sharma, and Swanand Kirkire, the four-song album strikes a harmonious balance. 



""**Doubtwa**,"" led by Sukhwinder Singh, sets a lively tone with its witty lyrics and catchy composition, offering insights into the characters' suspicions.



""**Sajni**,"" a serene melody crooned by Arijit Singh, provides a soothing contrast. Laden with string instruments, it encapsulates a rustic charm, accentuating the film's ambiance. 



Meanwhile, ""**Dheeme Dheeme**,"" arguably the album's pinnacle, combines Ram's composition, Swanand's poignant lyrics, and Shreya Ghoshal's vocals to create an unforgettable piece, enriched by captivating musical arrangements.



Returning to a lighter mood, ""**Beda Paar**,"" sung by Sona Mohapatra, adds depth with its intriguing arrangement, showcasing potential visual splendor in the film. 



Ram Sampath crafts an engaging album that complements the film's narrative and stands on its own merits. Both the movie and music is a must experience thing, If it's playing near you, go watch it!",05-04-2024,2,0,Review

The days leading up to me leaving him, he sexually assaulted me and then comforted me after. It was the lowest point of my fucking life. 

After I left, he followed me, stalked me, and harassed me continuously. Until, I filed a police report. Which was enough to scare him off. 

The police report was the worst. I was lucky enough to talk to two very kind police officers. But i felt so embarrassed having to answer their questions as to how he assaulted me. It felt so ugly having to explain every little thing he did to hurt me, whether physically or emotionally. 

It‚Äôs been a year since he last sexually assaulted me. A year since he stalked and harassed me. It doesn‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs been a year. I still feel like he‚Äôs haunting me. I‚Äôm still just as scared by people as I was a year ago. I still retreat anytime someone wants something with me.

I didn't disclosed all this to my parents bcz they are of conservative mindset, Now the problem starts, that guy's mother got cancer even though she got fine but since then that guy's parents forced him to get married, but he kept postponing it bcz he wanted to marry my sis, and my sis was/is preparing for upsc/govt jobs so she cant marry him until she doesn't get any govt job, my sister used to stay tense all day, now 1 day that guy casually pranked my sister that he is getting married and sister burst into tears, it was around 1o clock in night when she came to me crying telling me everything, from the next day she started staying depressed all day.

My parents noticed all this and asked her, then she told everything to them, and they supported her. They consulted with psychiatrist got her proper medication and her condition started to improve. Now my parents started convincing her to leave that guy bcz that guy is from delhi and we are from up, my parents were concerned about it, but my sister refused to leave that guy, she said she will either marry him only or will stay single forever, (I belong to a community where love marriage/ staying single is still a crime), so my parents tried everything they can to convince my sis (even though she is also not wrong completely), so my parents told my sister that they can think about marriage only if she secures a good govt job in that region. Even though they said so but my father still tried to convince her to broke up with him but she refused, and finally stopped talking to my sis and said that he has no relation with her now.

With all such problems my father also fought with my mum and stopped talking to her (even though they are talking now but not too much). My sister started preparing for govt job and she is doing progress, but now she is not doing her best, she spends whole day binge watching some sitcom and studies barely 2-3 hrs. With such actions she is not going to clear any exam and when I tell her to study she just start shouting at me. My once happy family is now broken just bcz of my sister and my father's ego issues.

At first I was constantly trying to add fills and stretch out a bit during guitar solos but the more I play the more I prefer a simplified sound. 

The songs have a variety of simple and complex bass lines so I'm not just chugging eighth notes for three hours straight but on a song that calls for chugging eighth notes I think it sounds way better just keeping a rock solid groove with no fills.

Keep in mind I'm playing more guitar centric music and genre's like reggae and Motown can allow the bass player to step out.

I guess I'm just in this head space of a rock solid, simple groove sounds better than flashy improvization.

Hello! I was made to wear braces as a kid, even though my teeth were already fine. Looking at pics from before that, my face wasn't nearly as asymmetrical as it is now. I know I simply grew up to be deformed, since I get more crooked by the day, but I suspect the unnecessary braces played a part.

My question is, could wearing braces for a second time make my face more symmetrical? Wearing them years ago aligned my teeth, as the third pic shows, but I wouldn't mind messing them up in exchange for a normal looking jaw. Is it possible to achieve with orthodontics alone, or would it require surgery?

Exotic Weapon Suggestions,ddaulisi7,1,1cjrwzp,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cjrwzp/exotic_weapon_suggestions/,0,"So, for some context, I absolutely love voidlock. My main build has always been built around Contraverse, but I‚Äôve experimented with Briarbinds/Nezzy‚Äôs fair bit too. Neither of them really click with me. 

I‚Äôve always run WH in my kinetic slot as my exotic, a void weapon with demo in my energy, and whatever heavy to fit the given situation. 

With the release of onslaught though, I‚Äôve fallen in love with Mountaintop and Edge Transit. I‚Äôve also recently become attached to a crafted demo/AJ Word of Crota as my energy, replacing my demo/frenzy Unforgiven. 

I‚Äôm wondering how big of a deal it is that I can‚Äôt really see where to fit an exotic weapon into all of that without losing something important.

 I could go back to WH, but that also locks me out of Mountaintop, Riptide, Scatter Signal, and any other kinetic I would want to run (for reference, I prefer my kinetic to be special). 

I could swap out my WoC for something like Graviton Lance, but then I lose out on demo, which really helps tie the build together. 

I could also swap out ET for something like Dragon‚Äôs Breath, but then I lose out on monochromatic synergy and, frankly, ET or something like Apex will probably stay the preferred dps meta for a while. 

Does anyone have an idea for how to get around this problem? In end game content (on the rare occasion I‚Äôm freed from the shackles of well of radiance) is it even really a problem?",05-04-2024,1,0,Question

Shalee had no issues with Jada using her money to get access. In order to keep up the lie Jada had to pretend while in Beth‚Äôs lives and when Jada did that, Shalee took a direct offense to it. I guess it‚Äôs too hard for Shalee to understand that‚Äôs what she had to do to keep the accounts that Shalee and many others used. 

Shalee likes to talk down to people. She is condescending and controlling. If you don‚Äôt see things her way or do as she says, she will rudely tell you. Shalee decided to treat Jada like shit for defending Beth (on a fake account) in the live, even though it was to help make sure Beth didn‚Äôt remove her. Her and Jada stopped taking because Shalee refuses to ever apologize or admit fault. 

The next day Beth received a Sam‚Äôs club order, B&B order, and a fridge. She accused Jada of this and stirred up a lot of drama with zero proof. Shalee thinks Jada did all of this to get back at her, because Shalee is just that important. 

Shalee is now spreading lies and calling anyone out who questions her. She put Jen on blast with no hesitation, someone who is very kind and friendly to all. Everyone in the group has said something about Shalee some time or another but won‚Äôt confront her. Why? Because if you say anything she will easily spread your personal or identifying information. She will tell everyone your struggles you confided in her while she was pretending to be your friend. 

My questions is when is enough, enough? Shalee is allowed to spend other peoples money to access Beth‚Äôs IG. Shalee is allowed to call Beth and Devin on their cell phones 90 times a day? Shalee is allowed to go in real life with Beth? We are condoning people to go to Beth‚Äôs home and follow her to work so that they know where she works? We are condoning sharing her work location?

Ideas to fix terrible eating habits.,Faux_extrovert,1,1cjrwya,AskParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1cjrwya/ideas_to_fix_terrible_eating_habits/,0,"My boyfriend has really backed himself into a corner with bad eating habits, particularly with one kid. He has three daughters:

11yo- plays soccer and has private 10lessons/conditioning multiple times a week. When I met her she said. ""I never have to eat anything I don't want to."" So this kid eats no veggies or fruits ever. She eats nachos, fries, cookies, chips, etc. Dad doesn't really think it's a problem bc she trains a lot, so the unhealthy food doesn't affect her. She's also his ""golden child.""

9yo-gymnast who trains 12 hours a week. She's a good eater. Eats a fair amount of fruits and veggies. She's not part of the problem.

9yo-(fraternal twins) She is not in physical activity, so she spends most of her time playing video games or watching YouTube. I'm not sure why she's not in a sport. She has terrible eating habits like 11yo. Never eats fruits or vegetables. She'd eat mac and cheese every day if she could. She's always in the pantry wanting cookies, chips, anything sweet. 

So dad is worried that 9yo is gaining weight bc she's inactive and has bad eating habits. Her sisters will call her fat when they're fighting. She will call herself fat or be worried about her stomach showing and clothes not fitting. Anyway, 11 and 9 basically have the same bad eating habits. He thinks it would help if he had less snack food available for 9, but doesn't want to restrict 11 from the snacks she likes. I think he should obviously work on fixing both of their habits whether 11 gets mad or not.

I guess my question is how  can he start to instill better habits? None of the kids are neurodivergent or appear to have issues with textures or anything.",05-04-2024,1,0,

Buddy says ""Dude, one more. Let's at least go see if you have a tombstone"". Fine, 5 min, let's go check. He brings in some extra stuff to help me. Check the graveyard when I got in, no tombstone. ""Man, I'm just gonna go to bed. It's not here. I'm tired"" ... ""Don't get off yet, what if it's in the dark aether? Let's load up and go in real quick. What's the worst that'll happen you already lost it all."" Whatever, I'll play a little more. We run some contracts, go to level 3 and load up, find some more randoms and squad up again.

I'm cold, hungry but full, I feel lonely even though I'm not, my mom's only in the room over, I'm comfortable right now but comfortability varies, I had an exciting day with a long 7 hour drive, and a long walk around Drumheller (Dinosaurs were fun and I loved it) but after all of it, once we got to the hotel room it felt like it was too much? Like I can't process what I've done and have to reel back, the public was fine for the most part, the drive was fine besides momentary anxiety. I just started ADHD meds and they DID help some but not a lot, but who knows it might help, I noticed my mind feels quite but I still can't focus correctly (might ask for an increase) but then I focus on all the wrong things, like how cold I am, how I feel slightly sick, how I don't like being separated from my mom even though it was my own choice, I'm shivering and have chills, it's too quite and too loud, and too bright, my stomach is warm and upset.

Hey everyone! So, I might have just stumbled upon the next big thing in the art world. No, it's not a masterpiece by Picasso or a mind-bending sculpture by Banksy. It's something even crazier... it's Chat Painter!

Now, before you start picturing robots armed with paintbrushes, let me break it down for you. Imagine a world where you can chat with an AI, and instead of getting boring text responses, you get... wait for it... images! Yep, you heard me right. Images conjured up by the power of words.

But hold up, this isn't just any AI we're talking about. This is the brainchild of someone who's been knee-deep in the world of image generation since before it was cool. We're talking academic papers, research galore, the whole shebang. And let me tell you, back in the day, generative AI was about as good at making images as I am at doing cartwheels (spoiler alert: not very).

But fast forward to today, and we've got Chat Painter strutting its stuff like it's on the runway at Fashion Week. Sure, it might not be quite the Mona Lisa just yet, but compared to the pixelated messes we used to get 6 years ago, it's a straight-up Michelangelo.

So, if you're tired of the same old boring chats and you fancy yourself a bit of an art aficionado, hop on over to Chat Painter and prepare to be amazed. Who knows, maybe you'll even commission your next masterpiece from an AI. The future is here, folks, and it's looking pretty darn colorful! üåàü§ñ #ChatPainter #ArtificialIngeniousness",05-04-2024,1,0,

In the game there were numerous temples, colorful lands like a desert of some kind, a place with a puppet being controlled by a giant hand, and you seemed to spawn in a huge grey castle it seemed. The aesthetic was very child-like with there being animals in a very animated look on Roblox. I believe there was also some sort of king on a throne in a place reassembling Ancient Egypt and there would be other places with a park and mountains. It was marked as a myth game at one point but wasn't very popular and I really want to find it again. Please help me find it It'll make me feel whole again. No this wasn't a dream. üòì

I have had Shaw (now Rogers) 1.5Gb down/150Mb up for many years.  Telus sent me a `SPRINGSAVINGS` promo code for Residential service.  The promo was:
    1.0Gb up/1.0Gb down for $65/month on a 2-year contract
    1.5Gb up/1.5Gb down for $75/month on a 2-year contract
    3.0Gb up/3.0Gb down for $85/month on a 2-year contract

I signed up for 3.0Gb and after a lengthy installation process, I was testing.  I never canceled Rogers/Shaw yet.  However, the brass tacks of it all is I hate to report that Telus filters incoming ports for Residential service.  If this matters to you, it's a big problem.  Their [security measures policy](https://www.telus.com/en/support/article/telus-hsia-security-measures-policy) mentions certain ports are blocked but in fact, all incoming ports seem to be blocked.

From a consumer-like-me point of view, the security policy is stupidly restricting ""to protect me"".  However, if you pay (a lot) more, you can get a business account that does not block any ports.

I had 15 days to trial the service and decided to cancel after 5 days.  There is no option (I've talked to many Telus departments - tech support tiers, loyalty, business sales, etc) to unblock ports except to go to a business account which doesn't block ports.  The business account is over $200/month on a 3-year contract (without a promo).  With a promo, I was offered as low as $115/month on a 5-year contract, $135/month on a 3-year contract.

There are a lot of technical details behind my testing but not worth mentioning here.  Things may be different on the lower tier speeds but for 3Gb, you receive the Network Access Hub (Technicolor NH20T), an SPF+ XGS PON and the WiFi 6E.  The NH20T is what's registered on the Telus back end, so you cannot bypass the NAH, plugging the SPF+ module directly into another device.

It was a fun 5 days...  but it wasn't something that was going to work for me in the long run.  Again, if having incoming ports open is important to you, don't bother.  Rogers/Shaw doesn't block ports.

Retaking Organic Chemistry 1 over the summer. Any advice on how to succeed??,KingDonutsz,1,1cjrwnt,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1cjrwnt/retaking_organic_chemistry_1_over_the_summer_any/,0,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I am taking a 5 week organic chemistry lecture/lab over the summer. I previously took ochem 1 in the fall, but had to drop the class since I was failing it. I know it's not gonna be easy, and I feel like the hardest part of the class will be keeping myself motivated and on top of the fast pace that it will have compared to the one I took in the fall. 

  
The problem that I faced when I took ochem 1 in the fall was doing all those practice problems in the textbook, and giving up after only a couple of hours. I also didn't go to office hours as much as I should have, which is something that I regret not doing to this day.

  
I'm also a terrible test taker, and the ochem class that I took had 85% of your grade just for exams. I'm still figuring out effective study strategies, but they seem to change for each class that I take.

  
So I have to ask:

  
1. How do I keep myself motivated to study ochem?

2. What are some effective study strategies to doing well in ochem?

3. What are some resources that I should use that will help me learn ochem the best?

  
Also note, I am not a chemistry major, and I just want to know the best way to get through the class without crying myself to sleep every night.

Any Adoptees end up in unconventional family structures or dynamic? ,Personal_Storm_7570,1,1cjrwmk,Adoption,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/1cjrwmk/any_adoptees_end_up_in_unconventional_family/,0,"I know every adoptee has a unique story, but I haven't found anyone with experiences quite like mine.
TW: My story includes some challenging circumstances.

I'm an international adoptee and an only child. One of my parents is American, and the other is international. My parents met while working unconventional, off-the-grid careers.  They initially chose not to live in the US, relocating to my dad's home country. However, safety concerns eventually led them to settle in an up-and-coming US city.

I was adopted in a very stable period of their lives and they have always had their hearts in the right place. My mom found a good agency and I was adopted alongside others with the same identity as me. However, 2008 happened, which led to my parents going through bankruptcy and divorce, and basically having to start over on their own with a young child (no family around in my hometown). 

Since I was 5 or 6, I was a 50/50 kid, moving every few days between my mom or dads residence, a product of some occasionally tense and oppositional co-parenting. It was hard, but I am the rare split custody child who never choose to settle down or choose one home, even after I left home for college. 

My home life is quite unconventional; neither of my parents remarried, so I would always return home to one of them, often being the only other person in the household. This dynamic led to a unique relationship with each of my parents. My mom has been in several relationships, she‚Äôs had a lot of highs and lows, including two broken engagements. While I won't delve too deeply into it, I believe both of my parents, have unresolved traumas to address, resulting in our homes never being the epitome of mental health and stability. 
My dad briefly dated when I was younger, but there was some drama despite the woman and her family being nice.

The economics I was exposed to while growing up were very interesting. I experienced what some children of divorce go through, known as the 'part-time poor' phenomenon. My dad managed to maintain a steady job, providing a somewhat middle-class lifestyle for me, with gradual upward mobility as I grew older. On the other hand, my mom prioritized being a parent and didn't focus much on employment, leading to more frequent financial struggles compared to my more middle-class peers. Living with my mom, without the insulation of suburban life, allowed me to interact with people from various backgrounds, sometimes much tougher than my own in different ways. 

In terms of my own well-being, it was honestly quite challenging, and I haven‚Äôt really been able to catch a break. I wanted to support my parents, which forced me to mature quickly in some aspects. Because of my complex upbringing, I didn't have much in common with many of my peers and struggled to fit into the adoptee community. I've faced my own mental health struggles, exacerbated by my family situation, but my family has always managed to pull through and support me the best way they could up to me leaving home for college. Things have honestly not settled and are still constantly subject to change, but I can say I‚Äôve turned out ok so far, and that building community with other people and sharing stories has been very important to my own sanity.

Found out my parents helped my abuser come back to the US,Interesting-Gold5252,1,1cjrwl9,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1cjrwl9/found_out_my_parents_helped_my_abuser_come_back/,0,"TL;DR I was SA'd by older cousin who's parents forced him to leave the US due to his gang affiliation (almost SA's by another cousin too). I told my parents years afterwards (2017) what both did/tried to do did then 3 years ago (2021) cousin who SA'd me came back. A few days ago, I overheard my aunt talking to my mom about paying the last bit of what she owes to her from the money that my parents lent her. My parents lent her $ to help my cousin immigrate back to the US. Not only that but they're forcing me to attend cousin's quince (15th birthday party) where my other cousin will be attending too on the day I'm graduating from University. 

___
**Really Long Post**:
I (now 22F) was SA'd when I was 7 years old. My abuser was my older cousin, ""A"" (12M at the time, now 27M) who not only SA'd me but told another cousin that I ""didn't fight back much"". The other cousin, ""R"" (11M at the time) told me what A said when I was visiting him and said that he'd be there for me if I wanted to talk. 

Turns out, R only told me to get me to trust him (since at the time, I kept sticking with my parents instead of playing with my other cousins when I was forced to visit any part of the family [I have a *lot* of aunts, uncles, and cousins]). He convinced me to go with him to his room and watch him play some new game he got on his playstation, but when we got there, he closed the door behind us and then tried to SA me as soon as I sat on his bed. He only managed to touch me a bit when I snapped out of it and pushed him off. It was a two story house so I kept pushing him until his head was sticking out the window. I don't even know how I mustered the strength since he was taller than me by a lot but when I did, I told him the first threat that came to mind. That I'd kill him if he tried to touch me again. After that I ran out, went to my parents, and stuck by my dad the rest of the time we were there. 

Ever since that day, I haven't seen R since he stopped going to the family events. However I still had to face A a lot up until he and another cousin got into some gang. When that cousin got killed in a drive-by, A's parents sent him to our family's home country, so I thought that was the end of that. I was going to keep quiet about it all but one day in 2017 I told my parents after reading about Terry Crews' SA. I felt so weak when it happened so reading Terry's story (about this huge, bigger than life man, say he was scared too when he was SA'd) gave me the courage to finally tell my parents. I honestly don't remember what they said (if they said anything at all), I just remembered my ears burning and ringing as I talked. 

Didn't do therapy or any of that. Just tried to get on with my life afterwards. Was fine up until 3 years ago when my parents told me A was coming back to the US. When he did come back, they forced me to go with them to my aunt's house to welcome him back. They told me A had a girlfriend and kids now so he wouldn't try anything. I guess that was their way of comforting me? I went, not wanting to cause problems and convinced myself that maybe my dad would talk to him. Rough him up a bit since he had always been the type to say that'd he'd hurt anyone that tries to hurt us. 

On the way there I wondered if they believed me when I told them. But then I saw his girlfriend. Keep in mind A was 24 at the time he came back. His girlfriend? 18. Eighteen with a 3 year old and 1 year old as their kids. I'm no fucking math genius but that meant he knocked her up when she was 15 and he was 21. So if my parents didn't believe me when I told them, they at least found out he's a disgusting individual who messed with a minor. Then my dad went up to him and hugged him. Told A to be good, and not cause problems for his mom. 

They continued to force me to go anytime we visited my aunt (who A lived with) and I was terrified each time. So much that I never even went to the restroom despite needing to for hours at a time. Ended up 3 seperate times at the hospital due to holding it in and ending up with UTIs. Thankfully, my parents didnt force me to go as often since I began doing internships and came up with excuses to not go. 

Now, a few days ago it was one of my cousin's birthdays. My parents offered to host the party but I stayed in my room in case A came. He didn't thankfully so I went out to grab some food but when I was about to step out I overheard my aunt (A's mom) saying that she would give my mom the last bit of money (about $1.5k) she owes her. I have another cousin (A's younger sister, M) who is about to celebrate her quince with a huge party on the 19th so I assumed my mom had lent her money since my parents were the godparents. 

Then a day later, I went with my mom to help her get some groceries when we saw some beer on sale and she told me to help her load about 20 cases saying that she would contribute that for M's quince. Each case was about $38 which meant she would be contributing about $760+. That's when I did a double take. $760 PLUS $1.5k as contribution for the party? So I got home and told my sister about how much our mom was spending. And as soon as I mentioned the 1.5k my sister kind of froze for a second. (Note: she knew I was SA'd since we both been through a lot and tell each other everything). That's when she told me that when she was getting picked up from school 3 years ago, my mom and dad were on a call with my aunt who was asking them for money to help my cousin immigrate back to the US with his girlfriend and kids. That my aunt would do payments to pay them back eventually. My sister added on that ny parents hesitated but honestly, I don't know if I can believe that they did. 

When I tell you my heart sank, it sank. I wanted to cry, scream, just ball up and sob. My own fucking parents helped my abuser come back. They helped him, then didnt even feel guilty enough to let me stay home when they visited my aunt. They forced me to see him and they saw how I was hospitalized more times than I shouldve been for getting UTIs from holding in my own piss. I didn't say anything to my sister though, simply thanked her for telling me and told her not to tell my mom she told me. 

After that I've been keeping my mouth shut. Been distant (more so than usual), but today really wrecked me. My mom told me my cousin R (guy who tried to SA me) would be one of M's chambelanes (male escort who dances with the birthday girl) and she was telling me to mentally prep myself. So not only would A be there but R would be there as well.

I was quiet for a few seconds before I asked her if we can skip on the quince. If we could just skip out on the party and celebrate me graduating from Uni instead since I graduate the same day on the 19th (The **first** in my family to graduate Uni. Not just graduate but graduate with honors and TWO degrees). I had been fine with not doing anything for my graduation on the same day, but finding out about my parents helping A come back, A being at the party since he's M's brother, and R being there just made me regret agreeing to postponing my own celebration. 

She quickly shot my request down and told me that my aunt has always come to our birthday parties so the least we can do is go to M's quince. I then asked her if, at the very least, I could miss. Told her I couldn't face either of them. Again, she said no and I had to learn to deal with it. So I nodded my head and went back to my room. 

And that's where I'm at. Typing this on my phone. Counting each day until the 19th approaches. A day I thought I would be so **fucking** happy because after years of going through so much, I could show something of it. And I'm not even gonna celebrate my own achievements. So, fuck my life.

I orgasm when I connect to God.

And I started to orgasm , non stop , extreme powerful orgasms . I even started to feel in my stomach like something pumping
It. Was incredible .

One source about this 
‚Äî-
after telling a British morning show that they can have full-body, 18-hour orgasms by simply hugging.

But their dispatches from the bedroom became even more bizarre in an interview with The Post, where the Los Angeles residents said their marathon climaxes sometimes involve a higher power.

‚ÄúYou start having more and more experiences that are out of your body, connected with God ‚Äî orgasms with trees, with water or just directly to the divine,‚Äù says Scott, 47, who claims his and Melanie‚Äôs 18-hour sexathons are drug-free.

‚ÄúWhen she came back and [laid] down on top of me, I felt our marriage, our souls just go hmph, right up the sky. And for just a little while, I felt at one with God, whatever that means to you. Heaven. It was so blissful.‚Äù

The couple recently attended a tantra festival in California, where they introduced newcomers to the concept of sacred sex.

‚ÄúWhen you start orgasming with God,‚Äù explains Melanie, ‚Äúyou feel divine love energy just entering your body everywhere. It‚Äôs amazing . . . the pulsation of that energy coming in and out as you breathe.‚Äù

Melanie is so in touch with her spiritual nature that she doesn‚Äôt even need Scott to send her body into earth-shattering convulsions.

‚ÄúWe were camping, and I was alone in the tent just laying down on my stomach, and I just start feeling earth energy just coming up through me. I start vibrating, and I realize my booty is vibrating and jiggling a lot. I realize that I‚Äôm orgasming with the earth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I was, all night long.‚Äù‚Äî‚Äî

with my partner , it happens like when I assumed something and almost broke up, and as soon as I felt he was gone, 
I started to orgasm multiple times .
Even
Though
I‚Äôm heartbroken I
Did that. Spontaneous without thinking sexual , just the thought he‚Äôs gone. 

‚Äî-
And then I thought 
.
Is this why I say 
Oh God during sex,
Without even saying Gods name in other situations ,
I just randomly say it.
And think about
It. 
Wouldn‚Äôt heaven or Gods presence or whatever you want to call it
Be amazing if you just orgasm the whole time non stop.

That's
How I know what ,.
Love
Is , and a simple orgasm during sex . 
It's just because of doing the sex act ,
The bland one that
Should be meant for something else 
A thing
For lovemaking. 
And you will want more to
Have greater better sex . 
So yes that leads to
Random sex that never fulfills you. 
I had horrible experiences of sex being bland,. 
Before my partner ,
I did orgasm , because I had a toy or whatever , . And I was happy with that for sex. One orgasm . 
When I actually fell for my partner , 
Every touch was orgasmic
Like a cuddle, I could just feel love vibrating, 
And just yea. 
It was next level. 
So I was like wow
This
Is how sex is when you are in love:.

I then read more this source ‚Äî

God has manifested in the world as sex. If you go to the old scriptures you will find it so particularly in Hindu scriptures. Why did God create the world? Hindu scriptures say, ‚ÄúBecause desire arose in him - sex arose in him - he created the world.‚Äù All creation is out of sexual energy, desire - kama. But Hindus have been in a way very courageous.

They say God created the world; then he started creating animals, trees. How did he create so many trees? How did he create so many animals? What was his plan, blueprint?

How did he start working on such a complex world? Hindus say it is very simple. First he created a cow.... Hindus love the cow, so of course God has to create the cow first. And the cow looks so divine, so silent and graceful. He created the cow, and then he fell in love with the cow. No other religion is so daring - the father falling in love with the daughter. The cow is his daughter; he has created it. He fell in love; now what to do? He was in a mess himself. So he became a bull because that is the only way to love a cow; otherwise how will you love? To escape from that - as women are always escaping....

Female energy escapes. That is the game. Not really that a woman wants to escape; she plays the game of escaping. Hmm?... if a man approaches the woman and she simply is ready to go to bed with him, the man will start feeling a little worried. What is wrong with the woman? Because the game was not played. The whole beauty of love is not so much in the love as in the foreplay. You make so many efforts - the courtship? But the courtship is possible only if the woman is receding. Just see. Whenever you are talking to a woman, if you are interested in her, she will be moving back and you will be moving forward. But there is always a wall, so the woman goes against the wall; then she is caught. She always moves towards the wall - that too is intentional! It is all intentional.

It is the whole game, and a beautiful game.

So the cow started running to escape from the bull. She became a tigress. Then God has to become a tiger. She became a lioness - just to escape. God has to become a lion. And that‚Äôs how the whole world was created: the woman escaping; the man chasing. A beautiful story, and very true.

That‚Äôs how the whole world has been created: one energy escaping; another chasing.

Hide-and-seek - the woman hiding and hiding and hiding - and the beauty of it - and God finding her again and again, and she again hiding, and God finding her again - in new forms, in new flowers, in new birds, in new animals. And the game goes on‚Ä¶ infinite is the leela. Hindus say God‚Äôs play is infinite.

But all play is sexual. Play as such is sexual because it is not work. You play it for its own sake. That‚Äôs why the Hindu conception of God is far superior to the Christian and Mohammedan and Jewish conceptions of God. The Jewish God looks like a worker, almost proletarian, a sudra. The Hindu God is not worried about work; he does not belong to any union of workers. He is a player, an actor. The whole world is his play. He enjoys it, and there is no end to it. In itself it is the end; it is not a means.

That‚Äôs the difference between work and play: work is always end-oriented. In itself it is useless, in itself you would not like to do it. You go to the office, to the factory, to the shop, and you work the whole day because something that you want - a car, a good house, a beautiful woman - is possible only if you earn money. You are not working in the factory because you love it, you are not in the office because you love it. You love certain other things, but they are not available without the work, so you have to fulfill the condition somehow. So you carry the work. The goal is somewhere else.

Play is totally different. You are playing; there is no goal to it. In itself it is the goal. You are enjoying the very activity in itself.

Anyway , 
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts ?

BRILLIANT!

Why wasn't Yokoya Port (Later known as  Kyoshi Island.)  pick as a Shang City?,Afraid-Penalty-757,1,1cjrwjh,Avatar_Kyoshi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar_Kyoshi/comments/1cjrwjh/why_wasnt_yokoya_port_later_known_as_kyoshi/,0,"Granted  Yokoya only become  famous and rose in prominence mostly due to being the home of Avatar Kyoshi and would later go on to become Kyoshi Island after she split the peninsula from Chin and his army.  But still based on the map alone you probably think  Earth King Feishan,  Fire Lord Gonryu,  and High Chief Oyaluk would have pick that small village due to geography wise.

I know that Yokoya was poor so I could that being a reason for not becoming a Shang City  but we see this before in real life where before It become  Tokoyto   we all know today  Edo was once a poor fishing village as well it was not until when The Tokugawa Shogunate made it into the capital that it rose to prominence and grew wealth  over the next 200 years and beyond.

So  If  Yokoya Port was pick as  a Shang City  It could have experience  a much more growth in terms of wealth like Edo which later go on to become Tokoyto  and with it becoing a Shang City at least until trade was finally reopened  then I could the conditions being a lot better during Kyoshi's lifetime?  Any interesting what if scenario especially we know that Feishan cares deeply for the poor in the lower ring of Ba Sing Se?

I‚Äôve looked through all the various video archives I can find and still can‚Äôt find it.

I‚Äôd guess it was some time between 2007 and 2009. He was sitting on a church stage having a Q and A with, I believe, someone representing the religious (probably Christian) opinion and a moderator. For some reason he was very red faced, possibly had had some drinks or something before hand, I don‚Äôt know..he also seemed uncharacteristically pissed off or stern (even for him) which is memorable too. 

He said a few things I remember, and I‚Äôm hoping someone knows the debate/Q and A I‚Äôm referring to:

If it took place in the middle of a city, then you'll live in that city.

It's not limited to disasters you are old enough to have experienced when they happened, but you are limited to the last 5,000 years of human history. 

As for the war option, i couldn't think of any other natural disasters, so I threw a war in for fun, but that would most likely be world war 2 unless there was a war that was worst that happened within 5,000 years. So if I'm right, you'll live in Berlin From 1939-1945 if you choose that option. If there was a war worst than World War 2, then you'll live in whatever city was most damaged by that war.

As for the ""Worst"" natural disasters... You'll live in the nearest city or the city it took place in and ""The worst"" would be decided by kill count how many were injured, and how much damage it caused. The priorities are in that order, so kill count would matter the most. In calling it the ""Worst"".

Looking for a Sata SSD because they run cooler than NVME SSDs. t will be in a 2.5"" sata enclosure, plugged into a usb 2.0 port on a Micca android TV box. It will be used \~10 hours per week max, and powered off the rest of the time. Once a week I will transfer over some videos. I probably won't delete stuff very often. I will just keep filling it up (and backing up the files by syncing them to a HDD ) and use it until it dies. I will may delete some things to free up space and add more data, but that probably wouldn't happen often. The limiting factor when transferring files to the drive will be Sata 3 transfer speed itself (600Mbps). Playing files will be limited by the USB 2.0 port (transfer speed 480 Mbps) which the SSD will plug into on the Micca android box. 

It is highly unlikely I end up needing to use the drive for anything else. I've got about $130 max to spend on the drive itself. 

Here is the enclosure I will be getting. It as a standard usb port which is nice, and also the way the enclosure fits together is a better design than the ones you slide the drive into and just hope it doesn't come loose and force you to open the enclosure to reseat it. 

SABRENT 2.5 Inch SATA to USB 3.0 Tool Free External Hard Drive Enclosure \[Optimized for SSD, Support UASP SATA III\] Black (EC-UASP) enclosure.

Young lawyer‚Äôs dilemma ,YeahImALawStudentWBU,2,1cjrwe6,nzlaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nzlaw/comments/1cjrwe6/young_lawyers_dilemma/,0,"Hello!

I‚Äôm a junior lawyer (<1 year PQE) in New Zealand. I have been with a small-medium sized firm for about 7 months and started with them as a law clerk. They paid for all of my admission costs (excluding profs) but I am not bonded to them. 

I always wanted to be in a bigger firm but just took whatever job I could get at the time so ended up where I am now. 

The other day I applied for the same role in a big firm and I got an offer from them. The salary is about $4000.00 PA more than what I‚Äôm currently on now and I get far more well-being benefits. 

I know that job progression in my current role is very slow in comparison to medium-large sized firms. 

So my question to legal professionals is, would you accept the new role and leave your old employer, who has invested a bit in you, less than a year after starting there? 

Would I be making a mistake or burning too many bridges in an industry where everyone knows everyone?

Mark was confused, I could see it. In my glassbox sitting at the edge of reality and time. Earth was long gone, eaten whole by the S'zangor, the Unbound, the Overmind which consumes all. But even they were dead now.

The only thing left was me, my box, a computer and Mark , the last human left alive standing in front of a normal polished wooden door.

""What were you expecting? Fireworks blasting the universe to shreds, a congratulations from God? No. It's just me and that door.""

""What's on the other side?"" He asked me.

""No idea, I just sit here and watch the door.""

There were only about 5 stars left in the universe now, and one of them flickered out as Mark stood there looking bewildered.

I clicked out of the Wikipedia page I was reading on my computer and leaned back in my chair.

""The place we're standing in has been around for, well, ever. Because it exists at the place where time has no meaning, I am at all times at the same time."" I told him

""What? The fuck is that supposed to mean?"" He asked.

""It means you have a long time to decide whether you want to go through that door or watch memes on my computer for the rest of eternity""

""Your computer has internet access?""

""Yup, you can access the internet of any time period with this bad boy. Only thing that kept me sane for all eternity. You remember that whole thing with the Cicada, yeah that was me. Oh fun times.""

""That means we can warn Earth about the weird alien things that are going to eat it."" He tried to push past me to do just that.

""Doesn't work that way I'm afraid. Can't interfere with the timeline in any major way."" 

I saw the disappointment in his eyes and offered him a lollipop. He tossed it out of the window as another star disappeared.

""So door or no door? I mean I know you have eternity to decide but try moving a little quicker"" I told him

He looked through the peephole of the door and stumbled back.

""Holy shit it's bright in there."" He said rubbing his eyes.

His spaceship just outside was sucked inside an anti reality sinkhole.

""Yeah magical super doors that hold secrets of the universe do tend to be bright"" I pulled out the 22nd May 1982 edition of the Times of India and started reading.

He turned the doorknob and the door swung open revealing the brightest light in creation.

""Is.... God in there?"" He asked

""God? Oh he died a few millenia before humans invented the wheel""

""God is dead?"" 

""Fortunately. Dude was a chatterbox. Seventh day of rest wasn't a good day for my ears""

""How old are you?"" He asked me

""I've been here as long as the door has."" I answered

""And how long has the door been here?""

Another star went out with a bang, creating the last supernova which was instantly snuffed out.

""The door's been here as long as I've been here"" I said with a chuckle

""Can you stop talking in riddles?"" He pulled up a chair to sit down with his head in his hands as another star fell out of existence.

""Talking in riddles is part of the job description. I haven't spoken to a real sentient being in a few billion years I'm allowed to be snarky."" I replied 

""So what's your move? Gonna sit here forever or are you going through the door.""

""Have you been through the door?"" He asked me

""Nope. Nothing ever has. It's been sitting here waiting for you for all time and untime."" 

""So this door was built just for me?"" 

""It was built for the last human left alive.""

""What will happen to me if I go through?""

""You won't be here anymore. You'll be somewhere else.""

""Where? There's stuff other than the universe we're living in?"" 

""I mean probably. Not in this entire dimension of existence atleast. Maybe this will wake you up from a dream or release you from the simulation. I don't know either.""

""I think I'll go through"" The last human alive told me

""Good choice. Safe travels friend.""

He walked towards the door.

""One last question, what's your name?""

""It's Jim. Jim followed by syllables that humans aren't able to comprehend and half letters.""

""Cool. Thanks Jim.""

He went through the door. The last star died in the silence.

I closed the door, locked it from the inside. And walked back to my desk. Finished writing this post and sent it back to 2024. I switched off my lamp, turned off my computer, and the Universe went away forever.

Previously I was likely eating around 2500-3000 per day. Sometimes I check the scale and get excited and think I have lost 2-3 lbs, but then I realize it's likely only water weight.

Checking Accuracy of Tengwar Transcription from Tecendil,Tyonosis,1,1cjrw6t,Tengwar,https://i.redd.it/11dlohn87cyc1.jpeg,0,"Hi all! From the time I‚Äôve spent browsing this thread before posting I know that this is probably an annoyingly common type of post, but I‚Äôm planning on getting my first tattoo soon, and would like it to be a Tengwar transcription of the phrase, ‚Äúcelebrate a simple life.‚Äù This is an excerpt from the full quote, ‚ÄúIt is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life,‚Äù from the film version of The Fellowship of the Ring.

I‚Äôve attached the Tengwar transcription I got by using Tecendil to this post. Based on the research I‚Äôve done looking at various sources, this seems to be an accurate orthographic English transcription (I like the look of it a bit more than the phonetic transcription), but I of course want to double check before committing to the tattoo.

I‚Äôd greatly appreciate any assistance that the experts on this thread are willing to provide, including stylistic/preferential suggestions or comments! As a side note, I have greatly enjoyed the time I‚Äôve spent here reading so far, would love to invest more time in learning Tengwar moving forward.

Thanks!

I'm constantly fighting AI in fanny packs with no armor taking 6-7 shots from an AK to the torso to die while another drops instantly from 1 shot or 2. I put 2 magazines from the Glock 17 into a guy at point blank this evening and ended up having to stab him to death with my kabar (most hits also didnt register).

Is this an inconsistent damage model or really bad hit registration? The many missed knife attacks at point blank until I started stabbing instead of slashing makes me thing the second reason but I'd love to hear others talk about it. I'm getting tired of burning half a mag or more on a 1v1 because the AI strafing left to right and having visible blood spurts wont die.

I feel so guilty. I forgot her birthday. I wanted to celebrate with her but my cognitive functioning and memory are so bad right now. And then I ended up in the hospital myself.

StraightTalk Refusing to Unlock From Their Network,TheWriteStuff13,1,1cjrw4b,StraightTalk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTalk/comments/1cjrw4b/straighttalk_refusing_to_unlock_from_their_network/,0,"Hello! 

A couple of weeks ago, I lost my phone during a shopping trip. My mom donated her old phone to me, and I had the Mint Mobile team check to make sure the IMEI number was unlocked before I bought three months of service with them. Fast forward a couple days; I found out only after trying to activate this network that the phone is actually still locked to StraightTalk. I called their customer support with my mother present. They were ""unable to authenticate"" her account because she hasn't used their service in several months if not close to a year, and supposedly the only way they could authenticate the account was with two phone numbers she's frequently dialed within the last 60 days. I spent half an hour trying to get them to give me an alternative- somehow, they were able to confirm that she made eligibility criteria for a phone unlock and provided that info with no problem- but they refused to do it. I already bought the other phone plan- if I had known the phone was locked to them, I might have purchased through them, but after the absolutely abysmal customer service I got from them, I don't want them to be my provider. I reached out to Tracfone, Samsung, and several phone repair shops nearby to try to find a way to get unlocked, but the answer I keep getting is that it's impossible to unlock a phone from Straight Talk if they refuse to do it. I filed a complaint with the BBB- had to give them the old phone number I no longer have to submit it because I can't get the new service I paid for turned on, so I don't know if they'll even be able to contact me if they would otherwise bother to do it. Corporations don't write these policies with the expectation that the consumer is going to like them.

I'm hoping maybe someone else who has lived through this problem could tell me if it would be worth it to escalate up the ranks at the Straight Talk customer service lines. I don't have the money for a new phone, and it is the law that they have to unlock you from a network- the consumer doesn't suddenly lose that right after 60 days- but it also seems like that law is being treated more like a recommendation than a legality on every front. I don't want to spend more of my time spinning my wheels through meaningless customer service apologies, driving myself crazy asking for alternatives to an absolutely absurd authentication process just to never make any progress. Any advice on getting some advocacy for the issue besides filing complaints they probably won't even care about or digital spaces where I could leave honest reviews about their poor customer service that might make an impact would also be appreciated. 

I left MetroPCS because of their absolutely abysmal customer service (they refused to provide my transfer ID when I presented with my ID at the local store- which was really just the final nail in their coffin) but maybe customer service just sucks everywhere.

I can avoid the severe performance drop but...,Necessary_Phone_67,1,1cjrw2x,officialwarzonemobile,https://www.reddit.com/r/officialwarzonemobile/comments/1cjrw2x/i_can_avoid_the_severe_performance_drop_but/,0,"> TLDR. Recent released update performed worse due to raised game resolution. Game don't like multiple touch screen interactions. Game is fine when run in very small windowed mode (PiP)

- Device: LG G8 Thinq (6gb/128gb)
- OS: Android 12
- CPU: Snapdragon 855

After the update, I can't play the game like before. Everytime I move, performance and fps drop so hard. 

BUT when I only use one finger for interacting the screen like for everything (movement, shooting, etc.), I don't experience that bad performance.

If I use both of my thumbs (or using 3 fingers), the game performance drops and sometimes the game will just crash/force close.

What the hell.

Changing the graphic settings don't help. I did everything I could even following other players posts here.

The last thing I did is to play the game in a very small pop-up mode (picture in picture mode), that fixes every performance issue I had in the game but I can't play the game since the buttons are covering the entire screen. 

(This confirms my thought that they raised the game resolution thats why its performing so bad)

Another thing, I have ""show touches"" on my phone enabled (shows a white circle on the part where you touch the screen) so that I can tell if my phone is the problem or the game. The game is performing bad but my touch inputs are fine. 

Like think of this scenario, the game is a powerpoint presentation but based on the big swipes you do on the screen while playing, the ""circle"" is following your touch just fine and not slideshowy like the game.

Stampy's adventure maps are still the best YouTube videos ever made,Halfpace500,1,1cjrw1i,Stampylongnose,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stampylongnose/comments/1cjrw1i/stampys_adventure_maps_are_still_the_best_youtube/,0,"This is going to be more just a positive rant I've wanted to get off my chest because Stampy and his adventure maps mean so much to me. I wasn't really allowed to watch YouTube as a very young kid but I was allowed to watch Stampy, Mainly his lovely world series of course, but my favorites then and now were his adventure map playthroughs with squid. I've always been fascinated and deeply drawn into worlds, stories, and lore and Stampy's playthroughs had all of those. It also had the benefit for me of being in Minecraft my favorite game at the time and it drew me in like you wouldn't believe. I only had pocket edition at the time and I never knew what to do on top of me being bad at the game so I just loved being sucked into these stories but what really always kept me invested was Stampy and Squid actually playing them. Their sense of humor, their really nice values, and so much more just made me happy. Stampy and Squid would always roleplay like they were really in the story and that just added to the magic for me, their time was just so wholesome on a level nothing else had ever topped. The maps they were on were so expansive and grand that is really impressive considering it was all built by hand that always touched my heart on a way modded or tool assisted maps never have and Stampy and Squid took full advantage of that. It really felt like a journey I embarked on with them, I have always wanted to be on a journey and an adventure and Stampy's playthroughs are one of the only things that have ever really facilitated that feeling. It, in a sense, completed me. It all felt so grand and I wasn't alone in that world I had Stampy and Squid that took me along, and never in a parasocial way but it made me feel cozy and comfortable. All the puzzles they worked out, or cheated through lol, were always so fun and it made me happy, it still does. I know another big part was that it wasn't just Stampy or Squid there were both of them together, if it was just one I think it would feel a little more empty and lonely. I can't ever stop gushing about them and occasionally they gave me an excuse to hang out with my family. I'm not very old now I'm almost 18 but watching those videos feels like a lifetime ago. I remember watching them after school, before school, on car trips and in hotels, everywhere I could. From time to time I watch them again and they hold up really well and I always enjoy them so unbelievably much. I thought about watching them earlier today and that's what drove me to write this post because I didn't watch them. I really wanted to watch them but I also feel a twinge of sadness I can't go back to that time it was better, not perfect but much better. I can't go back as much as I want to and Stampy's maps remind me of them in so many ways, they were all great memories but sometimes it just gets me sad watching them. Those videos just mean so much to me, and I don't want to make anybody sad I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don't talk about this much but Stampy's adventure maps mean so much to me and I don't care if they make me a little sad, Stampy and those videos will always be a part of me. Don't know if anyone will see this but if you do read this at all, thanks for listening even though I couldn't get everything off my chest it means a lot, and see ya later.",05-04-2024,1,0,
New York brokerage offering $300-$850 to Aussies just for signing up and depositing,DollarsDylan,1,1cjrw1d,unimelb,https://www.reddit.com/r/unimelb/comments/1cjrw1d/new_york_brokerage_offering_300850_to_aussies/,0,"Link -¬†¬†[https://www.webull.com.au/s/Q2cZ1vvIixCxI9TLoV](https://www.webull.com.au/s/Q2cZ1vvIixCxI9TLoV)

Webull are trying to expand into the Australian market, if you're a basketball fan you might've heard of them as they're the main sponsor of the Brooklyn Nets. They're currently running a few promotions to entice Aussies to sign up, you can get $100 for signing up and depositing $200. The $100 bonus comes in the form of fractional Tesla shares which you can sell straight away and trading vouchers which you'll have to use to buy shares (pick any) then sell them straight away to cash in. After that you can withdraw your $200 + the $100 you just made.

They're also running another promotion where you get $200 in additional rewards (they come in fractional shares and trading vouchers as well). To get this one you have to deposit $1000 and hold that balance for 30 days. After depositing you'll get the first set of $100 of rewards which you can sell and withdraw straight away, however you'll have to wait 30 days to get the additional $200 in rewards. After which you can cash them in as well and withdraw your $1000 deposit plus the rewards.

If you have a lot of capital free you can also do their other promotion where you deposit over 10k and maintain the balance. With this you get $150 more in Tesla shares plus $400 in trading vouchers after the first 30 days of holding the balance and $400 in trading vouchers every 3 months ongoing until the 30th of April 2025. You could also just cash out after the first 30 days and make $550 in profit from this promotion. You'd also get the $300 from the other promotions doing this so you can make $850 in 30 days however I know a lot of people don't have a spare 10k sitting around haha.",05-04-2024,1,0,Opportunities

Master's in Interaction Design: Good or Bad?,SaifAhmed98,1,1cjrw0s,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1cjrw0s/masters_in_interaction_design_good_or_bad/,0," I am Saif Ahmed from Bangladesh, studied Bachelor's in Business Administration from BRAC University and I have 3 years+ design experience in social media contents.

For the last 3 years, I have been designing social media contents; static mostly. Coming from a business major in my university, I have always wanted to pursue my higher studies in design. I personally never felt any further interests in business background after completing my undergrad.

Last year, I have joined a startup with the responsibilities of designing their in-app elements along with some social media contents and I got to know some surface level knowledge in UX/UI. As I was working for a digital product, these user experience and interface related functions and tweaks has driven my interest into interaction design.

However, with the news of many industrial level layoffs and Ai takeovers made me feel insecure and afraid about pursuing my career in this field. But I want to be confident about myself and aspire to be better in UI/UX. For higher studies in Interaction Design, I have selected US as my primary destination as there are so many prestigious design schools/colleges in there.

Before I bite the bullet, I want to take some key insights and valuable advices from this community. Hope ya'll will be helpful enough to share your personal thoughts and experiences. TIA.

"Training AI for Rotoscoping using 3d Gaussian Splatting, 3d Video Tracking, and 3d Software.",Plastic-Metal5095,1,1cjrvyq,NukeVFX,https://www.reddit.com/r/NukeVFX/comments/1cjrvyq/training_ai_for_rotoscoping_using_3d_gaussian/,0,"Inexperienced newbie here. As I searched online for rotoscoping tools that utilize AI, I was surprised to find many (including nuke) perform tasks subpar to what humans can achieve while still requiring hard effort especially for a novice like me.

This got me thinking about why hasn't anyone combined AI technologies to create a script that creates 3d replicas of objects (using gaussian splatting in Polycam), tracks the subjects with simulated 3d replicas (Blender), and then creates a mask based off the 2d view of the mixed dimensional output (Script instructions).

  
**Possible benefits**

* No webbing of mask when script is used for simpler shapes and silhouettes
* One click rotoscoping tool that accurately separates subject from background based on splat/depth data

**Possible limitations**

Dynamic shapes

* Unless the 3d replica (gaussian splat) is able follow deformation of the subjects, transforming shapes
   * If distinguished parts of subjects are separated, trained AI models will have more accuracy  
* Gaussian Splatting needs multiple angles to create an accurate 3d model
   * If multiple angles are captured, shape deformation may be able to be tracked, keyed, and used.

**Possible iterations**

* Input key phrases so AI knows to create a replica that is within the limits of said parts (body, shirt, pants, shoes).

  
I'm probably not the first to think of this and may be overlooking majors flaws in my methodology, but think this could have potential if someone hasn't tried/done this already. Either way is consumer AI advanced enough to make this a possibility? Are there any AI algorithms already rotoscoping good enough to where this wouldn't be necessary? Was typing this a waste of time?

I was thinking that if instead of Kaiser being a  dick to Isagi it would be interesting if he was nice and interested in the Blue Lock philosophy. This would add another layer of complexity to Isagi‚Äôs later realisation that he has to take the team from Kaiser if he wants to succeed in the Neo Egotist League. On top of this Kaiser‚Äôs backstory in the current leaks would act as a second gut punch to Isagi finally taking control of Bastard.

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and am very interested in securing a programming job post-graduation. I'm eager to make the most out of my time in college and am looking for advice on what additional steps I can take to boost my employability in the tech industry.

I‚Äôm interested in Machine Learning and/or Backend programming. But I could also learn full stack. Till now I‚Äôve used Python at intermediate levels and C++ at beginner levels. I‚Äôve also done some projects on Bash scripting for Raspberry Pi projects. 

1. **Events and Competitions:** Which programming events or competitions should I consider participating in? How have these helped you in your career?

2. **Networking:** What are some effective strategies for networking within the tech community? Are there specific platforms or groups you recommend for connecting with industry professionals and peers?

3. **LeetCode and Coding Practice:** Is investing time in platforms like LeetCode beneficial for improving my coding skills and job prospects? How often should I practice to make a noticeable difference?

4. **Skill Development and Certifications**: What certifications, projects, or skills would you recommend I focus on during my degree? Are there specific programming languages or technologies that are particularly valuable in today's job market? 

Additionally, if you have tips on internships or extracurricular activities that could be beneficial, I‚Äôd love to hear about them.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and insights!

PS : I‚Äôm in India but down to go aboard on my own expense if I get confirmation of employment.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*



\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*



I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.



Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.



It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!



---



\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!



What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.



\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.



\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It was a privilege to host the DCI this week. Very emotional for me at times, actually. 

I know we're all here because we struggle with drinking. I also know that we're more than our drinking, and certainly more than what our drinking can turn us into. 

There's a tension there, I think: In focusing on my relationship to alcohol, what I'm really doing is opening myself up to life beyond it. 

This is what I find so scary about saying ""I will not drink with you today."" Anyone can say ""forever"" or ""for the rest of my life"" or grand meaningless stuff like that. (Drinking makes you really, really good at saying grand meaningless stuff, I think.) But ""today"" is tricky because it's right there in front of us and yet we still don't quite know what it means. So: IWNDWYT. 

And if you have thirty or more days down and would like to host in the future, reach out to u/SaintHomer. Thanks, all. Enjoy your weekends.

I understand unlucky streaks are a thing but the weighting is very very heavily shifted towards under 90% rolls since the hotfix of May 2nd.


I usually do sets of 20-30 in a go, then wait for the items to sell to craft more.
But ever since the hotfix, all my rolls are in the 50-70 range. A few 80 here and there and like 1 above 100.

Yes, luck is a thing, unlucky streaks are a thing. But after having done over 100+ crafts, maybe even 150+ crafts over the last 2 days, only 20% were above 100% rolls.

I rolled 6x 50's, 4x60's, 10 between 70-90. 1x above 136 and some other fodder. In almost all my set rolls, this seemed to be the case.
Not a single time did I roll the opposite of having lots of high rolls and not many low rolls.

Before, this would happen where I would have a set of getting 5x 140 rolls, and then a set with 5x 50 rolls. But i only rolled a few that were even breakeven in the last 2 days.

I talked to someone else also crafting the adorned, and he said in 50 sets he saw the same pattern appear and he was rolling mostly below 90% as well.



This is still speculation, but the adorned MIGHT be adjusted and weighted in a stealth nerf they didn't tell us about.

If anyone has done high quantity rolls in the last 1-2 days, please let me know your findings.",05-04-2024,1,0,Discussion :twoc:

GRE: 314( v=155,q=159)

IELTS:8

Work Experience: 1.5 yr of Work Experience as a Java Developer

I've been wondering if Switzerland is a better place to go for Master's than the USA rn. There are a few things I'm worried about.

1. How much it will cost me, which university to prefer and basic part time pay
2. Housing and Living Expenses 
3. Job Market and Work Permit

I'm from India and I'm working in TCS rn with a very low pay. Will complete 2 years in the company by October. Wondering if Switzerland will be a better fit for me than jumping into the band wagon and going to the US rn.

My school is not bad, but some people are very transphobic, and I feel like It would just be better to stay In my calm little closet until I graduate.

As far as I can tell. Im done with ssri's. I was taking Pristiq. a month of being on 25mgs it just made me lazier. But after 6 days on 50mgs it made me damn near suicidal. I had to have a talk with my family it was so bad.

My next appointment has been moved to next Thursday... at 6am. The plan was to talk to him about ketamine or tms as the next treatment option. Because I don't think I can make it through the first month of these ssri's. they all cause to much emotional blunting.

But Im starting to really consider maoi's as well.
After reading some of the experiences others have had.
The closest anything has ever gotten to making a dent on my depression was adderall. But I'm not taking it anymore. It's not for depression anyways.

My boyfriend still lives with his ex girlfriend. ,ElegantPlantain4931,1,1cjrvph,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1cjrvph/my_boyfriend_still_lives_with_his_ex_girlfriend/,1,"We‚Äôve now been dating for 4 months. He lives 45 minutes away so we see each other over the weekend. Three months ago I found out he‚Äôs still living with his ex. We were on video chat and I suddenly heard a woman‚Äôs voice, and he quickly hung up on me. We talked for hours after that. 

Apparently he is stuck in this situation because of finances. 

I believed him, for a while. Now I am skeptical. 

There are a few red flags: 

1) My biggest one is that I am a secret from his ex. When she‚Äôs home we can‚Äôt video chat, only text. I‚Äôve asked plenty of times why she doesn‚Äôt know about me, and he says it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt want confrontation. 

2) he‚Äôs bailed on me at the last minute, like three of four times. Without a really good excuse (I‚Äôm tired, etc) 

3) he has met my family but I have not met his. I was actually supposed to see his family this Sunday, but when I asked tonight to confirm plans he said that his brother (the family i was going to visit) is tired and doesn‚Äôt feel like it, so he‚Äôs going to come down to see me. 

4) Disappeared on me once when I was expecting him and his explanation was that he got annoyed with me blowing up his phone so he just turned it on silent and left me wondering where the hell he is when he was supposed to come visit me, those were the plans. I only started blowing up his phone when he wasn‚Äôt answering a few hours after he was supposed to be here. So‚Ä¶.? I don‚Äôt know. 

5) He said last week that he‚Äôs going to move in with his brother later this May, when his ex gf is going on vacation. But the only reason he said that is because last week I got pretty upset at him about the whole situation and the fact that he‚Äôs not doing shit about it for so long now. But‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt made any further plans or even mentioned moving in with his brother after that one conversation. He is renting a home with his ex girlfriend and I‚Äôm not sure how it all works but I don‚Äôt know if he can just abandon his house just like that? Just sneak out of his house and not come back? He doesn‚Äôt seem to have a plan. 

Besides this he treats me amazingly and I love him so much! He talks as if he is very serious about me and our future. I feel the same way. 

I need advice from people on the outside, I need as much opinions and advice as I can get. What should I do? Should I be concerned? What is your opinion on this whole thing? 

Thank you.

üé®ü§ñ Introducing... drumroll... Chat Painter [https://chat.openai.com/g/g-MlnIZE08v-chat-painter](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-MlnIZE08v-chat-painter)! üéâüñåÔ∏è

Hey everyone! So, I might have just stumbled upon the next big thing in the art world. No, it's not a masterpiece by Picasso or a mind-bending sculpture by Banksy. It's something even crazier... it's Chat Painter!

Now, before you start picturing robots armed with paintbrushes, let me break it down for you. Imagine a world where you can chat with an AI, and instead of getting boring text responses, you get... wait for it... images! Yep, you heard me right. Images conjured up by the power of words.

But hold up, this isn't just any AI we're talking about. This is the brainchild of someone who's been knee-deep in the world of image generation since before it was cool. We're talking academic papers, research galore, the whole shebang. And let me tell you, back in the day, generative AI was about as good at making images as I am at doing cartwheels (spoiler alert: not very).

But fast forward to today, and we've got Chat Painter strutting its stuff like it's on the runway at Fashion Week. Sure, it might not be quite the Mona Lisa just yet, but compared to the pixelated messes we used to get 6 years ago, it's a straight-up Michelangelo.

So, if you're tired of the same old boring chats and you fancy yourself a bit of an art aficionado, hop on over to Chat Painter and prepare to be amazed. Who knows, maybe you'll even commission your next masterpiece from an AI. The future is here, folks, and it's looking pretty darn colorful! üåàü§ñ #ChatPainter #ArtificialIngeniousness",05-04-2024,1,0,GPT

about a week ago i connected my speaker to my google tv chromecast to play the sound out of it and ever since then it hasn‚Äôt worked. i don‚Äôt know if this has anything to do with it but it‚Äôs a coincidence that it only starting acting weird after i did it. (the device is now forgotten from the tv) the speaker won‚Äôt power on when not plugged in, the tone won‚Äôt play and the light will turn on but will blink for a while before turning off again after 10 seconds (without playing a tone). When it is plugged it, the power light will blink white and when i press the power button it will play a glitchy snippet of a sound and it does the same if i hold it down. the bluetooth button works if i press it a few times, and it will connect with my phone without playing any tone, and then it will play my music normally. however if i take it off charge it will only play for ten seconds before turning itself off (without a tone). nothing happens when i try to check the battery power (pressing + and -) and i have tried so many times to reset/ hard reset it but nothing works. i‚Äôve had it for only 7 months and over the past few months have started using it almost every day, including in the bathroom when i shower and around the pool. i‚Äôve never noticed any water inside the charging port or anything, but maybe the constant exposure to the moisture is effecting it? please help it‚Äôs my baby i love it so much but it has given up on me üò≠ if anyone knows what‚Äôs wrong with it please tell me, and if this isn‚Äôt appropriate for this subreddit please let me know and i‚Äôll find somewhere else to ask.
is it a problem with the battery? do i need to leave it on charge for a few days? or is it moisture in the system? 
it‚Äôs been like this for a week and i can‚Äôt go much longer without a speaker. i don‚Äôt want to have to buy a new one but i will if this one isn‚Äôt fixable. thank you üôè

Arranged Marriages Service 

I am a Black M (23) I plan getting marriage in the next couple of years. I have decided that based on my current generation of black females and their mindset that an arrange marriage with African women would be best option for me long term. I can‚Äôt afford picking the wrong woman, future no fault divorce, child support, alimony and all the drama that comes with it. I stopped trying to date years ago, and these short term 6-12 month relationship are a waste of time and money. I would rather court to marry. 

 I am very passionate about this because I was a product of a single mother household and with now being in my 20s I know exactly what my mother did wrong. I have been blessed by God to have discernment and discipline to get myself into a multi 6 figure career without any felonies, children out of wedlock or any serious mental health issues. This is  how I break the cycle and I believe it starts with me. 

If any of you know of any reliable marriage services to match with African Women please comment or DM me. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Question ‚ùì

today I tried using one of those crystal hair erasers of Amazon but it hurts rlly bad so my question is, what am I doing wrong? do I need more blades on my razor? am I actually not shaving correctly on that area?

Can I do 2 Summer Internships Simultaneously?,Cchung1234a,1,1cjrvm5,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/1cjrvm5/can_i_do_2_summer_internships_simultaneously/,0,"I'm an undergraduate student, and I have found two internships, one of which is part time and a passion of mine (pro bono, labor rights, etc.), and the other being commercial law, and full-time. The second one is a very reputable firm, and has a moonlight clause, but the first doesn't; I talked about moving my working hours to fully online, so I can do it over weekends if necessary to which they agreed. Essentially, I think I can pass off the first internship as a volunteering position; Would this breach the clause below?

""This offer letter shall supersede any prior agreements, promises, representations or understandings of any kind, whether made orally in writing or otherwise with regard to the subject of your employment.""

If I could, I would move the second internship over to the next summer, but I'm scared that if I ask them, they'll simply say I can't come in. Reason why I want to do this second internship is 1: It would be more experience at a respected firm, and it's paid, which would really help out (first internship is an unpaid volunteer-internship).

Caveat is that from what the hiring officer told me, I'm going to be the only undergraduate intern in the cohort, so I'll probably receive a lot less work.

Should I go through with both? If so, the dates overlap completely. Can I maybe ""edit"" the date for one of them, so that it doesn't overlap on my resume?

Should I wait until end of Summer to update my LinkedIn, or can I do it now?",05-04-2024,1,0,Help Me Decide

The same goes for the skaters leaving. Uzi and Ricky are great skaters. But, it seems like sometimes their emotional state was bringing down the whole production. All the best to them. Maybe JD will leave soon too?

There will always be someone there to film the videos. There will always be some hungry skaters that want to use the channel to boost their audience, so they film some videos at an indoor skatepark.

Problem:  
Windows 11 - Was able to find my Alexa Echo 15C & pair, my headphone QC13 could be paired too the problem in windows 11 was that they were disconnecting a lot and couldn't play any sound on it. Tried different drivers, troubleshoot in windows, installing by asus crate and nothing worked. Just couldn't make it to play any sound.

Windows 10 - Was able to pair only with my headphone QC13 but it wasn't playing any sound neither and disconnecting all the time. In Windows 10 I couldn't see my Alexa and pair with it, bluetooth can't see it. Same things done in Windows 11.

All the videos I've seen when they show the services in Windows, there's a Bluetooth Support Service, Bluetooth Audio whatever... Can't see any of them when I open the services in Windows.

I'm going to reinstall Windows 11 since my test in Windows 10 didn't work.

So mid march I started with a very violent cough and it was treated with some medicine from my GP and by April 1st week it was gone. But from April 1st week I started continuously burping throughout the day, after some acid and gas reducing medicine from my GP it was under control but I would still burp 20-30 times a day.

Slowly it started affecting my throat and my voice would break while speaking as I feel my throat being pulled. Also after eating I would feel a little pain in the stomach that would go only after burping / farting and I would feel normal.

So I went to a GI on 19th April and he diagnosed me with GERD/ Drug induced dyspepsia; dysbiosis and gave me the following and said it's not SIBO otherwise my stomach¬†**would become inflamed like a balloon**:

1 month of

* **Rabeprazole 20mg (PPI)**,
* Ganaton OD \[Itopride\] (helps with gastrointestinal motility),
* Gaviscon Syrup, and
* 2 weeks of¬†**Rifaximin (400) Twice a day**

So yesterday I finished the 14 days Rifaximin and was also eating really bland diet. Till now major incident that happened are:

On Day 4: I continuously burped which included dinasour burp, vomiting burp (nothing came out apart from burping) for 6-7 hours and next day my BM was dark brown mixed with yellow (like 2 separate clay just joined into one)

On Day 12: After eating Idli (Rice Cake) + Coconut chutney I burped for 20-30min.

On Day 14 1st dosage: I started burping in 10 min, and later after 1 hour of eating I burped till I slept.

On Day 14 2nd dosage: I started burping after lunch (curd rice), also some gas pain in the stomach and today (Day 15), I had a loose brownish stool and some same color mucus.

Masters in Interaction Design: Good or Bad?,SaifAhmed98,1,1cjrvj4,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1cjrvj4/masters_in_interaction_design_good_or_bad/,0,"I am Saif Ahmed from Bangladesh, studied Bachelor's in Business Administration from BRAC University and I have 3 years+ design experience in social media contents.

For the last 3 years, I have been designing social media contents; static mostly. Coming from a business major in my university, I have always wanted to pursue my higher studies in design. I personally never felt any further interests in business background after completing my undergrad. 

Last year, I have joined a startup with the responsibilities of designing their in-app elements along with some social media contents and I got to know some surface level knowledge in UX/UI. As I was working for a digital product, these user experience and interface related functions and tweaks has driven my interest into interaction design. 

However, with the news of many industrial level layoffs and Ai takeovers made me feel insecure and afraid about pursuing my career in this field. But I want to be confident about myself and aspire to be better in UI/UX. For higher studies in Interaction Design, I have selected US as my primary destination as there are so many prestigious design schools/colleges in there.

Before I bite the bullet, I want to take some key insights and valuable advices from this community. Hope ya'll will be helpful enough to share your personal thoughts and experiences. TIA.

Horror story I witnessed between a Tactless DM and an Oversensitive Player. ,Mister_Chameleon,0,1cjrvhm,rpghorrorstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/1cjrvhm/horror_story_i_witnessed_between_a_tactless_dm/,1,"Have you ever wondered what it was like to witness an RPG horror experience in person? Well I did almost a year ago and I‚Äôm here to recollect on it. It occurred at another table so some details are missing. To explain this properly, it‚Äôs probably best to share some context. I play almost exclusively at a Local game store, since my computers for some reason hate roll20, barely works with D&DBeyond, and (for in-person fixes) no one else in my family plays D&D or other TTRPGs.  
  
To my chagrin, I'm something of a Forever DM, rarely getting to play outside of rare one-shots and have yet to enjoy a long-form campaign to it's intended end. However we did (at the time) have a second DM Mickey (not his real name), who was a cool and chill guy, but was also something of a problem DM and my attempts to play under him did not go well and only kept giving him chances because I was that desperate to be a player instead of a Forever DM, letting me learn the hard way ""no D&D is better than bad D&D"", but my own issues with Mickey are not the focus of this particular story, only his lack of tact at this particular game. And if it matters, I did ask for Mickey's permission to post this story.   
  
At my table, my party of six had just become a party of seven, as my Rogue player (oldest player at the table, 47), asked me of his son (playing a Barbarian) could join the table after he had fun at a beginner one-shot. At first I was reluctant, given I had a hard enough time with 6 players and I was tempted to ask him to attend a second table ran by Mickey, but agreed to let him at LEAST play as a guest PC so he could play with his dad and I could see how he does. 

Needless to say, I'm very glad I didn't put Rogue's son at that table with Hexblade or Mickey, not just because of how nasty a mess it was to imagine our newbie having to deal with what was about to unfold, but also the fact that he proved to be a hilarious player and quickly got used to role playing, his Goliath Barbarian following the lovable idiot trope. A classic combination for a good reason.

So back on the day this occurred, Table #2 was basically ‚ÄúLadies night‚Äù as by coincidence Mickey had a party of only female players (four of them total), one was his friend (Druid), two more friends of this friend (Fighter and Barbarian), and one more girl no one knew (Hexblade). It was shaping up to be an interesting experience for Mickey, and the biggest influx of female players we ever had for a D&D night. Alas, Hexblade proved to be something of a problem however pretty quickly.  
  
Thing about Mickey is that he's not a bad DM in a malicious way, but he's very lazy, often refusing to prep sessions and 100 percent improv them, which is a shame given the few times he did take time to prep his sessions are really nice. Protip with DMing: one cannot just rely on pre-written things and improve alone, but must find a happy balance. He also very much hardly helped his players if they had questions, which I always found off putting. Even worse, he would rather go outside the store and take 10 minutes to vape instead of assist his very inexperienced players in filling out their character sheets, which I find entirely inexcusable.  
  
Fortunately, If I'm asked (and I was), I usually am willing to offer my own assistance during his absences so long as my own prep is finished first. After I help Fighter, who was playing for the first time get the basics done and give a minor attack tutorial at her request, Hexblade says she herself is new I thought she meant ‚Äúnew to the game‚Äù and she got irritable when I offered to assist her and break things down and she loudly clarified ‚ÄúNo, I mean I‚Äôm new to this place!‚Äù as she did not like that I had simply assumed the meaning of her admittedly unclear choice of words instead of, you know, calmly declining with a simple ""thanks but no thanks""? Thing is, I didn't even force my assistance, only verbally offered and she still flipped out as if she expected me to read her mind.

Hexblade did however clarify that she has a cognitive disorder (which I find understandable and could tell she was being genuine about it, having High-Functioning ASD myself) but it was clear quickly this girl was either used to getting her own way all the time or not used to having to compromise with other people very often.  
  
In addition to the rude outburst I mentioned previously, this is evident by the fact I made a joke regarding why I‚Äôm helping everyone even though it wasn‚Äôt my table once Mickey returns. I don‚Äôt recall the exact words I used, but the punchline involved Mickey being a bit of a moron. Hexblade got offended at this even though the joke was not directed at her in any way, as in her mind it‚Äôs not ok to joke about intelligence at all.  
  
Now, at the time I was apologetic, understood why it might have upset her, and I didn‚Äôt want to offend someone I had just met, I do believe Hexblade genuinely overreacted. I didn‚Äôt point the joke to her nor did I belittle her at all, and how my friends and I interact with each other is not anyone else‚Äôs business but our own. Thus as you can imagine, I got annoyed with Hexblade quickly and noped out once Mickey started to resume setting his table while I go finish preparing my own. I silently hoped for the best with Mickey's excessively passive DMing style and Hexblade's constant nitpicking about every little slight while clearly a bit nervous herself. 

However even while running my own session, in which the party met the new Barbarian hanging on a rope in a temple by the ankles and waving to the party while saying ""Hiiiiii"" with a moronic tone, I had noticed Hexblade was a problem that Mickey was struggling to handle. To begin with I noticed table 2 was not playing about 30 minutes after the starting time because Hexblade was taking too long with her sheet, having refused any help. Likewise, despite being so insistent on a Hexblade, she had Mickey ask me on her behalf while I was running my session if Hexblades use Charisma as their primary stat.  
  
Since I myself play a hexblade in Mickey‚Äôs games I get why he asked me instead of googling it, but at the same time shouldn‚Äôt Hexblade know the primary stat of her predetermined class if nothing else -especially considering her refusal to be assisted otherwise-? Alas Mickey, as I stressed, is a really lazy DM, relying on me to guide him a bit too much at times. On the inside I was facepalming, but answered quickly that yes it was Charisma. All of this while trying to focus on and run my own game of seven players, who where fighting against elementals and the Ranger got to avenge his previous PC from a different campaign.

Mickey honestly really is doing his best and he‚Äôs gotten better with presenting his homebrew world set in a lighthearted grimdark setting (which he somehow made possible). But I could still overhear Hexblade being confused, interrupting and asking if there were any homebrew mechanics instead of letting her DM speak. Mickey is not the best at getting his point across, so this occasion Hexblade‚Äôs complaint was understandable but still not the best way to respond.   
  
Mickey overuses the term ""homebrew"" mostly as to say it's his own setting, which is valid but is usually vague of what the setting entails, and with admittedly not many differences in his house rules and concepts compared to RAW aside from dragons having different breath weapons, the presence of goblin/elf hybrids, and allowing one to have more than one inspiration at a time. Honestly, It would have helped if he‚Äôd name his locations, settings, and NPCs instead of being lazy with his prep and world building, which doubtlessly fed Hexblade's frustration in trying to understand what she's getting into. 

In due time, about an hour before it‚Äôs time for my session with my own party to end, I noticed that Table 2 disbanded early in spite of their late start. I don‚Äôt actually know what occurred as a whole, aside from Hexblade being rowdy enough to catch the attention of some of my players now and then when she ended leaving early.  
  
Before she left, Hex apologized to her party and also to me both directly and indirectly for the rocky introductions on her way out, which I greatly appreciated as to me a willingness to say sorry instead of playing the victim says a lot about people. The other players left later on but still earlier than planned as they had work but did confide that they enjoyed the session a lot more once Hexblade was no longer present. At least I hope that‚Äôs the case and that Hexblade didn‚Äôt ruin their fun and discourage them from returning, but sadly never saw any of those players again.

Like I said, Hexblade is not a bad person, just problematic and admittedly a bit of a snowflake who needs to understand everyone -not just herself- has autonomy. Mickey did however offer her a spot on the Thursday game (which I play in once in a while) to give her a second chance. Honestly, I had a bit of dread hearing that, and even Mickey admitted once Hexblade left he is quietly hoping she won‚Äôt be able to make it that day despite inviting her since he wanted to be amicable. According to Mickey, the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was Hexblade insisting everyone be quiet while it was her turn in a far than less polite manner. Not like to lower their voices either but apparently be entirely ""pindrop"" silent, which is an unrealistic expectation even without considering my own table was playing too.  
  
This aggressive fussiness was causing stress to one of the other girls (Druid) who happened to be pregnant at the time and Hexblade became remorseful for her behavior on top of being overstimulated from everyone being loud (which is ironic given she mentions she can‚Äôt hear well and asked for Mickey to speak up more than once. This is not something I will shame Hexblade for as I suffer this paradox sometimes too). Mickey tried to assure he could still hear her just fine and not to worry but Hexblade wasn‚Äôt having it. It was at this Mickey put his foot down and politely suggested Hexblade ask for a refund from the store owner as this wasn‚Äôt the game for her. This is the only time I ever saw Mickey turn someone away, as he was usually pretty desperate for a high number of players since he had really bad player turn out most of the time.

Thursday came and went, Hexblade did not arrive. According to the store owner, he had actually called Hexblade‚Äôs mom to inform her (for Hexblade‚Äôs own safety) that she should probably have supervision next time she is present in the game store in the event of another meltdown or sensory overload. Either Hexblade‚Äôs mom could not spare the time to be there for a few hours, or Hexblade had other things going on, if not deciding on her own not to return as a year later I still have yet to see her again.  
  
Hexblade, if you find this post (somehow) on Reddit or being narrated by someone on YouTube, I wish you well on finding a suitable game. And thank you Mickey for giving me permission to post his tale. I hope it entertains everyone and eases your horror.

And for those curious, the Rogue's son remained part of the group for a good while, his impressive roleplay and dedication to the character he was playing more than earning him a spot at my table beyond simply a guest appearance, only leaving due to classes starting up. I miss playing with both of them, they were fun as a pair who played off each other well.

TL;dr: A passive and lazy DM and a sensitive player prove incompatible to the point this clash catches the attention of my table at times. Things end peacefully at least.",05-04-2024,0,0,Extra Long

"My research paper on Masayoshi Takanaka, rough draft (May 15th final)-student paper",DanielNate,1,1cjrvg5,JazzFusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/JazzFusion/comments/1cjrvg5/my_research_paper_on_masayoshi_takanaka_rough/,0,"Exchanging culture through music is a means for an artist and their audience to indulge in and appreciate diverse cultural traditions. Masayoshi Takanaka‚Äôs Brasilian Skies is a prime example of blending two diverse musical ideas to foster a deeper understanding of another culture. Masayoshi Takanaka has been creating and performing Japanese jazz-fusion music since the late 70‚Äôs. His music ranges from soulful, expressive, smooth grooves to energetic, punchy, and complex melodies. Takanaka steps out of his musical comfort zone to create his own reinterpretation of Brazilian samba and bossa nova, borrowing instrumentations and harmonic structure from traditional Brazilian music, along with integrating his melodic ideas from jazz-fusion in Japan, forging a connection between two disparate musical genres from different cultures. This paper aims to discuss the influences Brazilian music and culture have had on Takanaka‚Äôs Brasilian Skies by examining harmonic and rhythmic patterns, instrumentations, and other cultural effects at the time. This research offers insight into cultural exchange through music and will prove beneficial to musicologists and Takanaka fans.

# Samba, Bossa Nova, and Jazz-Fusion

Brasilian Skies is heavily influenced by Brazilian samba and bossa nova, separating this album from the rest of his discography. Samba is more than just music in Brazil, it involves music, dancing, and emotion. Samba is very expressive, but a broadened definition of sound would be very percussive, featuring a less-sophisticated harmonic structure, exaggerated accents, and melodic ideas that have a basic style with simple deviations. Early samba was heavily influenced by the sound of polka, habanera, marcha, and maixixe.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)Bossa nova is a samba-derived style but is less percussive, softer, and more harmony-oriented.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) Takanaka uses the musical elements from these two genres and blends them with Japanese jazz fusion. Jazz Fusion in its original form was a fusion of Jazz, Rock, and Funk music. It‚Äôs very rhythm and groove-driven and utilizes many electric instruments. Like most genres Jazz Fusion began incorporating some other sounds and genres notably world music, folk, progressive rock, and electronic music. Its sound is very experimental, energetic, and chaotic. Takanaka is breathing more life into the definition of fusion, by adding another layer of culture, borrowing elements heard in Brazilian music.

# Instrumentation

Jazz-fusion features a variety of instrumentation, as a generalization, Jazz-Fusion often features electric guitar, bass, synthesizer/electric keyboard, brass, drum set, vocals, and other selections. As with most ensembles, each instrument serves a role in the composition and complements each other differently. Generally, Drum sets keep time and help add more definition to the piece, the bass adds a melodic texture, keeping the groove. The keyboard accentuates the chord progressions while horns will add rhythmic interjections, and the Guitar with play chords, but in a more percussive way than the other voices.¬† Keyboard, Guitar, and Horns occasionally play the melody. In samba, music is built from the interlocking syncopated rhythms of the percussion. Similar to the previous genre, every instrument has a role. There are three surdos, large bass drums, each playing its own part, either keeping time or adding an improvisational rhythmic line. Providing more foundation to the beat is the pandeiro, which is played to provide a rattling or jingling effect. Jingling is also heard in the chocalho, which are jingles in a frame that are playing in a forward and back motion. Still in the scope of shakers, the Caxixi, or basket shakers are played to create a constant shaking to keep the rhythm or accented notes.¬† Agogo Bells are two metal bells joined by a handle, played with a drumstick, and squeezed together for a ‚Äúdrier‚Äù sound. The Tamborim provides a sharp sound, being the highest-sounding drum of the ensemble. Repinique which often is used as a solo instrument, as it‚Äôs more prominent, the caixa is similar to a snare drum, as it has a bright, rattling, punchy sound to it. An effect instrument that provides a distinct ‚Äúmonkey-like‚Äù sound, is the Cuica, which is a friction drum with a stick on the inside of the membrane, the squeak is produced from rubbing the stick with a wet cloth, and multiple pitches can be produced depending on where the player‚Äôs hand is on the outside of the drumhead. Samba uses a variety of instruments other than percussion; vocals are often used in call-and-response style singing, The Cavaquinho is a stringed instrument, similar to a ukulele, and the Apito de Samba, or samba whistle, which is used to lead samba schools, is also a prominent effect instrument used to lead the direction of the song. Bossa nova features Piano, Bass, clave, Tamborim. ¬†Samba Gafiera, a Brazilian subgenre, is played at middle-class samba dance parties, similar to Takanaka‚Äôs instrumentation, Gafiera features electric piano, guitar, electric bass, drums, and similar percussion, and horns. Takanaka uses all the instruments described above and blends the vocations of each instrument to form a new ensemble.

Featured Brazilian Artists

This new sound, birthed from 2 disparate musical genres, could not have been the creation of a singular musician, Masayoshi Takanaka recorded a majority of Brasilian Skies in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro in 1978. While visiting Brazil, Takanaka's approach to incorporating Brazilian musical elements into his new album was not only innovative but also collaborative, as Takanaka employed the brilliance of several influential Brazilian artists that have previously performed samba or bossa nova including Paulinho da Costa; an internationally known drummer and samba school bandleader,¬† Sergio Carvalho; a keyboardist and composer, Daudeth de Avezado; who played cavaquinho on the album, and Ary Carvalhae; a recording engineer that has worked with Jorge Benjor and Chico Buerque. Featuring these artists, and more Brazilian artists not listed, adds more integrity and authenticity to the music being created in this album, shifting the discussion toward cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. ¬†¬†

**Rhythmic Analysis**

Common rhythmic patterns played by keyboards and guitarists imitate the accent pattern in percussion. In bossa nova, whichever voice in on the bass, whether keyboard, guitar, bass or drumkit plays the surdo part. In samba, there are three surdo parts, the primary play the strong beat on beat 2, while the second plays on beat 1 but quieter, the third is an improvisational voice. Improvisational voices in samba often also include the repinique, cuica, Pandeiro, and Ganz√°. Many of these instruments double as keeping the rhythm, being the surdo, repinique, pandeiro, Ganz√°, and caixa. Instruments that highlight or primarily play accents consist of Tamborim, clave, cuica, reco-reco, cowbell, cuica, and surdo. Instruments that keep rhythmic pulse can act as accent instruments, and vice-versa when necessary. Many instruments have multiple responsibilities, for example the Pandeiro, that‚Äôs plays the pulse, accents, and bass accents all at the same time. In bossa nova, the keyboard will play closed block or inverted chords on the accents. In bossa nova, Jo√£o Gilberto introduced a new rhythmic idea to acoustic guitar- *viol√£o gago*, where the guitarist plays a simplified bass line with their thumbs, and accents with their fingers, imitating an entire samba band.

**Harmonic Analysis**

The harmonic structure of a piece is the foundation of the mood that is meant to be associated with the music. Japanese Jazz-fusion uses a mixture of chord progression commonly found in both jazz and rock. Fusion also features mode scales in the melodic voices based on the harmonic chord underneath. For example, If the piece was in C Major, and the chord underneath was a G Major dominant, the melodic voice would play a Mixolydian mode, being the fifth mode for the fifth scale degree. Any Chord progression found in classic rock, blues, and jazz-funk is considered a Jazz-fusion chord progression, there is no harmonic limitation in Jazz Fusion. In the title track of the album, Brasilian Skies, the intro uses a Guitar riff in E major, while the Cavaquinho plays A major over B as the harmonic foundation. This track features a ‚Äúturnaround‚Äù progression in the bass when the melody begins, I-V-I-V-I-IV-I-V-I. The Cavaquinho, a Brazilian acoustic-guitar-like instrument plays the chords under the electric guitar with a dotted quarter note eighth note repeated pattern.¬† During the bridge, Takanaka also takes influence from American jazz artist, George Benson, using a very distinct I-IV-vi-I progression, previously heard in the very popular song Breezin‚Äô. Another notable harmonic progression in the title track is the I-ii-iii-IV-V shifts while the arpeggios on B Major, a minor, g# minor, f# minor, and E Major arpeggios in the melodic line, creating a chaotic shift before resolving back to E major entirely. Throughout the entire song, the melodic line is based on the E major scale, occasionally outlining the e minor pentatonic scale. Outside of this album, in general, Japanese Fusion and Bossa nova share similar chord structures, as they are both influenced by the same genres of blues and free jazz. Bossa nova music usually uses cluster chords squeezing the 9th and 3rd together in tight voicing. Chord progressions commonly found in samba are: I-V-I, II-V-I, I-II-III, and I-iv-iii-VI7-II7-V-I. All harmonic sophistication existing in samba were influential to bossa nova.

Ranked Sucks,DavidTheWaffle20,1,1cjrvf3,DragonBallBreakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonBallBreakers/comments/1cjrvf3/ranked_sucks/,0,"The higher the rank the more miserable of an experience. I have gone down the ladder from Z3 to A1 by not going for plats and here is my findings.

1. Connection and Matchmaking is way better at lower ranks.
2. Raider is way easier. Why is Raider based on Survivor Rank?. I have noticed Z5 Raiders in A Rank lobbies but they arent as good as Z Rank Survivors who are Raider.
3. The difference between every rank is readily apparent. A Ranks tend to be really bad. S Ranks are generally average or great with 1 big flaw. Z Ranks are Z Ranks but a lot are generally S Rank material who got carried by premades.
4. Supplies seem to be greater the lower your rank. This isnt exactly confirmed but every game in A,S and Z Rank seem to have less supplies the higher you are Ranked. I have played about 50 games so I dont have a huge metric but generally there seems to be supplies in almost every container in A Rank and I could get to DC3 in 45 seconds to 1 and halfminutes consistently. S Rank has slightly less supplies than A Rank but small cubes are in surplus in every breakable. Z Rank by comparison has less cubes to both. For most of these tests I was in areas with multiple people to keep results consistent but lower Ranks may not loot as good which I didnt notice but can be a variable. 

Let me know if you have a different experience or if you want me to do a more in depth analysis. Generally Ranked seems worse for everyone. I like Ranked for consistent teammates but hated the connection and load times but after doing this test I agree with the notion to remove Ranked.",05-04-2024,1,0,Discussion

Grossly under rated modules,Appropriate_Exit1550,1,1cjrvdn,modular,https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/comments/1cjrvdn/grossly_under_rated_modules/,0,"What modules do you think are completely underrated? Maybe a module that‚Äôs ok on its own but it‚Äôs incredible with certain combinations? Some examples:

Mutable frames:

 Especifically u frames because it‚Äôs a ton of utility for the hp. With parasites, you have a key framing meta modulator, 4  related wavetable oscillators, so 3/4 the modulation of an Swn, Euclidean sequencing, shift registers, a cross-fader, mixer, weird sorta quad vca. Oh yeah, those 4 related wave table oscillators? It goes to audio rate.  Why doesn‚Äôt this get the maths treatment?? It‚Äôs incredible!  

Mutable stages: 

This is super popular, how is it underrated?  Look at the quimem custom firmware. 6 stages of modulation, 6 simple asr envelopes, 6 Turing machines! 6 flat offsets! Sequencing, switched sequencing, 6 lfos. 6 attenuators!  Not to mention a harmonic oscillator. People joke about a rack of all stages, but you can sort of actually do that without few compromises. 

Intellijel 2x vca 1u:

Also popular. Why it‚Äôs underrated? It‚Äôs a mixer, you can do and/or logic and nand/nor logic with inversion. Stereo vca, a cross-fader. It‚Äôs so dense for what it is. I‚Äôm shocked no one has made a 3u 2hp clone. I‚Äôd buy 6 of them.  Pairs so well with the tetra pad too. 

Shuttle system:

This one is a stretch, but the endorphines shuttle system. Paired with an aftertouch enabled midi device, this it‚Äôs probably the most expressive modular instrument out of the box. A complex oscillator with 2 filters/low pass gates, effects, a stereo mixer, utilities. Shuttle control, while a pain in the ass to set up, can do so so much. Disclaimer, I have mine listed for sale because of I ever want to report someday I need to reel this hobby in. Also I know that no one is going to buy it so o get to feel like I‚Äôm doing something without giving it up. 


Typhoon/monsoon:
 It‚Äôs just hard to argue against any other effects processor in a small setup over this. Vca before and after the effect (typhoon) plus all the alternate modes makes it incredibly powerful. Probably not under rated, but I don‚Äôt see a lot of people using it over flashier modules. 


I know this was a list of hot takes of well reviewed modules, but it blows my mind people ignore some of these. The frames especially. Traffic has gotten so much love lately but frames has been around for years! It‚Äôs kinda shocking to me that maths and Pam‚Äôs get so much love when uframes and stages are usually viewed at a surface level. ",05-04-2024,1,0,

I don‚Äôt have anything in common with my colleagues and my job is remote anyway. The mom friends I‚Äôm trying to make are all so busy and it‚Äôs hard to form friendships with people you rarely see. And I don‚Äôt have any hobbies outside the home. My husband and I are introverted homebodies and before baby we‚Äôd spend most of our downtime at home. But he plays golf and keeps encouraging me to find my ‚Äúgolf‚Äù. He works full-time and it‚Äôs his way to decompress and socialise, things I also need to do as a new mom but I don‚Äôt, so I wind up getting so stressed and down.  

Being a new mom is isolating enough but what I would give to be able to call up a friend and arrange movie or girls night.

Alright, here goes. I'm 22, went to Technical School for Welding. Got a Welding job, got laid off when work ran out. Started doing Carpentry with my brothers a year ago. I asked the question what job would you choose if you knew you'd get it to one of my brothers. I realized what job I would choose. Welding and Carpentry will have me dying a bitter old man. However a career with the FBI as a Special Agent or a similar CIA, DHS, or DIA role would give me an adventure to conquer and master myself in, I could die happy knowing I lived a life well spent.

I've wasted a few of my good years, but I'm eyeing the military to get me to that end goal. I'm currently willing to invest 5-10 years and possibly more of my life to serve the country militarily. From what I could find researching the FBI and similar agencies would find military experience, especially Officers or people with Intelligence MOSs appealing, and I can use college benefits of service to get an accomodating Bachelor's degree or two that also provide back up options if my dream doesn't work out. I'm thinking I'll major in Intelligence Studies and have Chinese Language, Psychology, & Law as minors if possible.


With my goals being obtain a bachelor's degree, attend as many trainings, courses, and classes as possible to broaden my skill set, maintain peak physical fitness, learn to become a leader, and be involved in meaningful work that challenges my mind and spirit to become a better, more capable human being- all while building a desirable resume for the alphabet soup agencies- which is the best branch and MOSs I could seek to earn?",05-04-2024,1,0,Which Branch?

What I am confused about now is mental state. I kept crying and crying for 3 days , the day this happened I was trying to untangle a fairy lights wires and i couldn't do it and then this conversation happened. A couple of days later , I sat down till 1 am and finally untangled it and suddenly I felt something different. I have cried a couple of times since then but not by directly remembering this breakup situation. It feels very blurry. I felt satisfied at work , I've even texted him but ever since he's denied to come meet me one last time ( to not make things worse, he's also very sad btw , there's no malice there ,he just considers himself a coward),  so since then I have stopped feeling any strong emotions, whether of anger or hate or regret. I'm feeling bad for him because he looks very down these days , and I've mostly given him life advices but i don't understand how such a switch can happen in a nights time . From being so optimistic all the time ,he now talks (barely says anything) like the most hopeless person in the world. 
I don't know why I am unable to process my feelings, is this what happens after you've cried so much ?? Is it because is see no hope and my mind has accepted this or is it because I still occassionally text him . Has this kind of thing happened with you ?",05-04-2024,1,0,Update

My (F 25) bf (26 M) takes it personally when I assume that I‚Äôm a burden to him,AdCharming1024,1,1cjrp1d,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1cjrp1d/my_f_25_bf_26_m_takes_it_personally_when_i_assume/,0,"My bf and I have been together for 2 years. I‚Äôm someone who grew up with a lot of childhood trauma, and because of that, now need a lot of reassurance in my relationships. When I come to my partner to ask for their help with my emotions, when I‚Äôm upset and feel vulnerable, I get this distorted thinking about how my partner sees me in that moment. I‚Äôll start thinking things like: 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a burden to him. 
he doesn‚Äôt want to hear this.
I bet he wishes I was ‚Äònormal‚Äô instead of mentally ill 
Hes thinking I‚Äôm too emotional, isn‚Äôt he? 
Am I being too needy? 
Is he judging me right now?‚Äù


I start to then feel ashamed that I‚Äôm being emotionally vulnerable at all, and then because of that, I‚Äôll over apologize and say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm putting this on you right now.
I‚Äôm sorry, I know I‚Äôm not rational.
I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on you 
I don‚Äôt want to ruin your mood 
I‚Äôll stop talking now, I don‚Äôt want to upset you‚Äù

I usually want to make myself smaller in these moments. I realize that typically when I say these things, I‚Äôm looking for reassurance that what I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt true. Like I just want to be held and told I‚Äôm not crazy and that he understands. 
But, instead of reassurance, he takes it personally. He will say things in response like:
‚Äúis that who you think I am? Somebody who can‚Äôt handle emotions? 
Is that what you think of me? You think I‚Äôm such an asshole that you being emotional burdens me? 
You act like you don‚Äôt even know me.
Why do you think I‚Äôm such a monster? What have I ever done? 
All I‚Äôve ever done is love you and you think I‚Äôm a monster.‚Äù

He gets pretty frustrated when I start self deprecating  and making myself small. He will outwardly express his frustrations at me, and I will then feel even worse. t‚Äôs like a cycle. It‚Äôs been ruining our connection and caused me to feel like I can‚Äôt rely on him to reassure me or comfort me. 
Am I doing something wrong? Just straight up asking for reassurance that I‚Äôm not a burden is really hard sometimes. I don‚Äôt know how else to approach him when I‚Äôm triggered/in a vulnerable emotional state. How would you fix this situation? Any advice would be helpful. ",05-04-2024,1,0,

Do we have to forgive others?,Less-Pain-1212,1,1cjrp0p,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1cjrp0p/do_we_have_to_forgive_others/,0,"I‚Äôve seen people say that we must forgive others to be saved. However in Ephesians 4:31, it seems like you can be saved without forgiving others. Not saying that as a believer you won‚Äôt have an inclination to forgive others or that you won‚Äôt want to or something like that after receiving The Holy Spirit and God starts working on you. But I am saying that it seems like if someone puts their faith in Christ and then died seconds later and never got a chance to forgive others right before they died, they would still be saved. 

Ephesians 4:31:

31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. 32 Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
(NASB 1995 Translation)

In Verse 32, it reads ‚Äú just as God in Christ also has forgiven you‚Äù

Notice: ‚Äúhas forgiven‚Äù 

It seems like this reads that Christ has already forgiven the person who is being told to: ‚ÄúBe kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other‚Äù

I see also that in Mathew 6:14-15 
It says: 

14 For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.
(NASB 1995 translation)

But I think that this is like James 2:14-26

You don‚Äôt need to have works, it‚Äôs more of a thing where if you believe and have true saving faith, you are going to have works. Because like the thief on the cross, he didn‚Äôt have works. At least I don‚Äôt think he had works? So was he not saved if he had no works? No, he was saved, it‚Äôs just that he didn‚Äôt have time to do works. Does that mean that he had to do less work to be saved? No, we aren‚Äôt saved by works, we are saved by faith by grace. But the point is, we don‚Äôt need works, James is making the point that there is generally going to be works, of coarse there are going it be very specific situations where someone isn‚Äôt going to do works. Or, at least not consciously,  like it may be possible that in some mysterious was by you just believing and showing others you believe The Holy Spirit helps others by that work He did through you, but that‚Äôs a whole other conversation. You put your faith in Christ to be saved. I‚Äôm just saying you don‚Äôt need to do works, (like for example jump up and down 100 times), to be saved. Nor do you need to forgive others to be saved. But a true believer is going to generally forgive others. Of coarse you should forgive others and I believe a true believer will be led by The Holy Spirit to forgive others, but like I brought up earlier, there are specific situations where it seems like you don‚Äôt need to forgive others because of something like someone being on their death bed and dying immediately after becoming a believer. 

James 2:14-26:

14 What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and be filled,‚Äù and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? 17 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.

18 But someone may well say, ‚ÄúYou have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.‚Äù 19 You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. 20 But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 22 You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; 23 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‚ÄúAnd Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,‚Äù and he was called the friend of God. 24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. 25 In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? 26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.

**~Arizona Cardinals 2024 Draft Recap~**

**Preface:**

¬†¬† I am a diehard Arizona Cardinals fan with a passion for the game of football. I played football in high school, and I like to think that gives me decent insight into the game. However, I am by no means a professional NFL scout, and I could easily be wrong about any of the following players. My analysis is based on hours of scouring scouting reports, news articles, highlight reels, and play tape from websites like Pro Football Focus, ESPN, YouTube, and the NFL (to name a few). This piece is meant to provide a consolidated, in depth breakdown of the Cardinals 2024 draft class to Cardinals fans (or anyone else who might just be curious). I wrote this for fun, and with absolutely no intention to slander any player, coach, or executive mentioned below.

¬†

**On the Cardinals Rebuild:**

2018 to 2022 was a rollercoaster ride for the Arizona Cardinals. With five long NFL seasons that ranged from historically bad, to somewhat promising, to downright tragic, no franchise was in more need of a facelift. To his credit, Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill has achieved just that. After several disappointing seasons marked by epic collapses, some questionable contracts, and a devastating injury to franchise quarterback Kyler Murray (not to mention numerous scandals from the front office), Bidwill finally bit the bullet and cleaned house. First, he parted ways with his long-time general manager and friend in Steve Keim; a name met with disdain from Cardinals faithful. Next, he fired his head coach and offensive play caller, Kliff Kingsbury, just one year after giving him a 7-year contract extension (a contract which Kingsbury didn‚Äôt coach a single game under in Arizona). Bidwill went on to let go of essentially his entire front office and coaching staff, giving the Cardinals a clean sate to rebuild and start fresh.

The rebuild began when Bidwill hired his next general manager, Monti Ossenfort. Ossenfort came over from the Tennessee Titans, where he spent three years as the Director of Player Personnel. Before that, he spent 14 years in the scouting department for the New England Patriots. Monti is no stranger to success. In his 21 years working in the NFL, his teams made the postseason 16 times. Monti completed phase two of the Cardinals rebuild by hiring the team‚Äôs next head coach, Jonathan Gannon. Gannon was the coordinator for a historically good Eagles defense that led the team to Super Bowl LVII in the prior season, a game that they narrowly lost to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Following Gannon over from Philadelphia was the Eagles linebacker coach, Nick Rallis. Rallis became the next defensive coordinator for the Cardinals, and is widely regarded as a brilliant up and coming young coach in the NFL. Finally, Monti Ossenfort rounded out his new coaching staff by hiring the quarterbacks coach of the Cleveland Browns, Drew Petzing, to be the next play caller for Kyler Murray and the Cardinals offense. Petzing‚Äôs scheme leans heavily on a north south, hardnosed, power-run style of football that starkly contrasts with that of former play caller, Kliff Kinsgbury.

With his coaching staff in place, Monti Ossenfort did what any GM of a rebuilding NFL team would do - cut his losses and accumulate draft capital and salary cap space. That meant a lot of turnover for the Cardinals roster. To put it frankly, any player acquired by the previous regime not named Kyler Murray or Budda Baker was on the chopping block. Just look at the moves Monti made in his first two off-seasons. He cut perennial all-pro receiver, DeAndre Hopkins, from the team and let another star receiver in Marquise ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Brown walk in free agency. Players taken high in the draft, like Isaiah Simmons and Rondale Moore, were traded for spare parts. The result in 2023 was a Cardinals roster that ranked among the bottom-tier of the NFL. However, the team played with toughness and a passion for the game that didn‚Äôt exist under the prior coaching staff.

While it hasn‚Äôt translated to on-field success quite yet, it‚Äôs clear that Cardinals leadership is aligned on the direction of the team, and the players have bought into Jonathan Gannon‚Äôs coaching style. With another off-season under their belts, Ossenfort and co completely revamped the Cardinals roster. They added a plethora of young, tough, smart, and hungry players to the team, including 21 players through the past two drafts. With that in mind, let‚Äôs dive into the 2024 Arizona Cardinals draft class, which features a massive haul of 12 players who are all ready to make an impact in their rookie seasons.

¬†

**Rd 1 Pick #4: Marvin Harrison Jr. ‚Äì WR, Ohio State University**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This pick was surrounded by rumor and speculation for the entire offseason. With QBs pretty much guaranteed to go 1-3, the NFL draft essentially began with the fourth overall pick. That left QB needy teams like the Giants, Vikings, Broncos, and Raiders all threatening to trade up to this spot and get their guy before the competition, and Monti Ossenfort showed us last year that he‚Äôs more than willing to trade back for extra draft capital. Instead, the Cardinals GM decided to stick to his guns and take whom many scouts flaunted as the best player in this year‚Äôs draft. The undisputed best wide receiver in a draft class LOADED with talent at the position, Marvin Harrison Jr. projects to be a difference maker on day 1 for Kyler Murray and the Cardinals offense.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MHJ is a big bodied, strong, and fast receiver with virtually zero weaknesses in his game. He‚Äôs a polished route runner, who utilizes a plethora of moves to manipulate defenders off the line of scrimmage. He has the size, strength, and soft hands to make contested catches, and the speed to burn defenses over the top. My favorite trait about MHJ is his elite body control, which enables him to make outrageous plays at the boundary. He immediately fills a position of need on a Cardinals offense that already ranked top 10 in the league with Kyler Murray under center last season. With pro comps like Calvin Johnson, Davante Adams, and AJ Green (not to mention the Hall of Fame pedigree from his father), this pick was a no brainer for Monti Ossenfort and the Cardinals front office. Watch out NFL ‚Äì the K1 to MHJ connection could terrorize defenses for years to come.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: A+

¬†

**Rd 1 Pick #27: Darius Robinson ‚Äì EDGE/DT, University of Missouri**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In last year‚Äôs draft, the Cardinals traded the third overall pick to the Texans for a haul of picks that included Houston‚Äôs first round pick in 2024. As a result, the Cardinals were on the board at 27 with their second pick in the 2024 first round. With their pick, the Cardinals selected Darius Robinson, a 6‚Äô5‚Äù, 290-pound defensive lineman from Missouri. While he maybe wasn‚Äôt the splashy name that Cardinals fans were hoping for, he fills a massive need on a defensive unit that ranked second to last in the NFL last season.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Robinson is a big, strong defensive lineman with the versatility to play both inside and out. He‚Äôs an instinctive pass rusher, with good hands and long arms that allow him to get to the quarterback. He also has the ability to set the edge and shed defenders to stop the run and make plays in the backfield. The only knock to his game is his speed, which didn‚Äôt test at the rate you look for in a typical NFL edge rusher. Overall, Robinson is a high character, intelligent, and violent football player with the versatility to play multiple positions along the defensive line ‚Äì all traits that head coach Jonathan Gannon looks for in his defenders. He‚Äôs a proven leader, who was twice voted team captain of the Missouri Tigers ‚Äì an achievement that Robinson calls the greatest honor of his life ‚Äì and has aspirations to become a future head coach. On top of all that, only two SEC defenders received an 80+ pass rush and 80+ run-defense PFF grade since 2021: Darius Robinson and Will Anderson Jr. (the NFL rookie standout who the Texans picked third overall after their trade with the Cardinals in the 2023 draft).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: A

¬†

**Rd 2 Pick #43: Max Melton ‚Äì CB, Rutgers University**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After crushing day 1 of the draft, the Cardinals were poised to pick a much-needed cornerback at the top of the second round. In fact, they were sitting pretty at pick 35, with several big name corners like Cooper DeJean and Kool-Aid McKinstry falling in their laps. However, Monti Ossenfort chose to pivot, moving back to pick 43 in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons that delivered an extra third round pick to the Cardinals. After a run on corners in picks 40-42 that included DeJean and McKinstry, Arizona selected Max Melton with the 43^(rd) pick. Off the bat, this was an unpopular pick amongst Cardinals fans who would‚Äôve rather taken one of the bigger names at 35. However, with time to process the decision, this is now one of my favorite picks in this class.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Melton is a big, lengthy corner with the speed and versatility to make plays both in coverage and in the run game.¬† He has good instincts for the ball, leading the Rutgers defense in turnovers over the last three seasons. He‚Äôs extremely athletic, with a 4.39 40-yard dash that highlighted a top 3-graded combine performance among corners in this class. He improved his game every year in college, and he has the work ethic and attitude to excel at the professional level. One thing is abundantly clear from his tape: once he starts moving down hill, you do NOT want to get in his way. He tackles with a ferocity that will make his team captain, Budda Baker, very proud. He immediately projects as a starter in a Cardinals defensive back room that desperately needs depth and production. He‚Äôs also a great special teams player, with three blocked punts in 2022. There‚Äôs a very solid chance that the Cardinals would‚Äôve picked Melton even if they stayed at 35, as it seems he greatly impressed Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon in his interviews with the team. Melton even went on to say that within 2 minutes of meeting Gannon, he knew he wanted to play for the Cardinals head coach. If you need more convincing, Melton received high praise form Nick Saban on ESPN‚Äôs coverage of the draft. Saban said multiple times that he ‚Äúreally likes this guy‚Äù and had him pegged as his sleeper corner of the draft. Still not sure? Melton‚Äôs now teammate, Marvin Harrison Jr., gave the pick further props. MHJ tweeted about Melton following the pick, saying he ‚Äúalways respected his game‚Äù in their Big 10 matchups. This should be a fun matchup to watch in training camp.

**Rd 3 Pick #66: Trey Benson ‚Äì RB, Florida State University**¬†

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This isn‚Äôt exactly a position of need for the Cardinals. Starting running back, James Conner, is coming off a career year rushing for over 1,000 yards and scoring 9 touchdowns in just 13 games. Additionally, Michael Carter proved he‚Äôs a viable change of pace back who can backup Conner and make plays in the receiving game. That being said, Conner is now pushing 30 years old in the final year of his contract, and he‚Äôs never played a fully healthy season in Arizona. So, with the 66^(th) pick in the 2024 NFL draft, the Cardinals selected their RB of the future in Trey Benson.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Many scouts had the Florida State prospect ranked first among this year‚Äôs class of running backs, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. One of only three running backs to run a sub 4.4 in the 40-yard dash at the combine (4.39), and doing so at 6‚Äô0‚Äù 216 pounds, Benson is an absolute stud. His tape is full of explosive plays. He has the afterburners to leave defenders in his dust, and the size to break tackles in the open field. He also flashes soft hands and YAC ability as a receiver, which will be a huge asset to a dynamic Cardinals offense. He‚Äôll have to improve as a pass blocker to make it as a consistent starter in the NFL, but the same can be said for pretty much every college RB. Ultimately, Benson is another versatile weapon for Kyler Murray. He projects to have an impact in his first year, whether it‚Äôs filling in for Conner or earning his spot as a change of pace back in the passing game.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: A-

¬†

**Rd 3 pick #71: Isaiah Adams ‚Äì OG, University of Illinois**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is where the draft picks get slightly questionable from GM Monti Ossenfort in my opinion. Adams fills a position of need, but there were several other OL prospects available at this spot in the draft, including Kansas guard Cooper Beebe, who were universally ranked higher on draft big boards. That being said, Adams is another high character player (team captain at Illinois), which seems to be part of Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon‚Äôs philosophy. He‚Äôs also a proven mauler in the run game, which we know is an emphasis in OC Drew Petzing‚Äôs scheme.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A versatile player at Illinois, Adams started 14 games at left guard and 10 at the right tackle position. His numbers are significantly better at guard, where he projects to play in Arizona, but he was forced to slide over to tackle due to injuries at Illinois. He has quick feet that help him get to the next level in the running game, and he has the size and length to develop as an effective pass blocker. Overall, I‚Äôm glad to see the Cardinals front office is finally focused on building the trenches through the draft (something that can‚Äôt be said about the previous regime). Physically, Isaiah Adams is exactly what you look for in an interior offensive lineman. While he wasn‚Äôt exactly a name on most Cardinals fans‚Äô radar, he clearly fits the mantra and direction that Cardinals leadership has in mind. I would‚Äôve liked to see a higher touted prospect taken at this position, but I‚Äôm confident that Monti and Isaiah Adams can prove me wrong. Who knows, if Adams had the opportunity to play at left guard his entire college career, he may have been higher up on most draft boards.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: B-

¬†

**Rd 3 pick #82: Tip Reiman ‚Äì TE, University of Illinois**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Consecutive controversial picks out of Illinois by GM Monti Ossenfort. Tip Reiman quickly became the most polarizing pick among Cardinals faithful. Some fans claim this is a massive reach for a top 90 pick on day 2 of the draft, while others say he‚Äôs a good player who fits the Cardinals game plan on offense. I think there‚Äôs truth to both sides of the argument. Firstly, this isn‚Äôt a position of need for the Cardinals. Trey McBride is coming off a break out season where he was featured as Kyler Murray‚Äôs favorite target in the passing game, and Elijah Higgins proved he‚Äôs a serviceable backup tight end with play making ability. However, Reiman wasn‚Äôt drafted to make plays in the passing game - as shown by his lack of production as a receiver in college. He projects to play primarily as a run blocker, where he displayed an affinity for battering linebackers and defensive ends.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Once again, Monti Ossenfort and co demonstrated that they prioritize high character and violent play style. According to his coaching staff at Illinois, Tip Reiman only cares about two things: football and family. He‚Äôs a football junkie who joins a class of rookies who all play with passion and aggression. It‚Äôs hard not to like this guy. He‚Äôll win you over quickly in his press conferences and interviews. Also, he‚Äôs a freak athlete. Reiman boasts the highest athleticism score among tight ends at the combine this year, and possesses impressive speed for someone his size (6‚Äô5‚Äù, 275 pounds). The positive side of the Reiman argument is true ‚Äì he does fit well in the Cardinals offense. OC Drew Petzing likes to run 12 and 13 personnel to establish and play off of the run game. We already know Reiman loves to run block, and slotting him into that group allows guys like McBride and Higgins to make plays in space. If he‚Äôs able to produce in the passing game, especially as a red zone threat, I think the pick will prove worth the reach.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: C+

¬†

**Rd 3 pick #90: Elijah Jones ‚Äì CB, Boston College**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Arizona Cardinals rounded out their SEVENTH top 90 pick of the draft by addressing another massive need at cornerback. Elijah Jones (surprise surprise) is another highly athletic, highly physical defender who has the maturity and intelligence to succeed at the professional level. Nobody had a higher vertical jump than Jones at the combine (42.5 inches). During his team visit with the Cardinals, Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon were blown away by his ability to walk them through specific plays in his tape. Jones reminded both of them of current Cardinals CB, Garrett Williams, who was one of the few bright spots in a cornerback room that was mostly lacking in 2023.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After going through his tape, it‚Äôs obvious that Elijah Jones loves to play physical. He has the size and length to play in press coverage, and he‚Äôs not afraid to get downhill and hit somebody against the run. He shows impressive ball-tracking ability (5 interceptions in 2023 at BC), with good timing and technique to break up the pass in zone coverage. Overall, he‚Äôs another depth piece for a cornerback room that was decimated by injuries last season, with the potential to earn a starting job his rookie year. Considering all that I‚Äôve heard, read, and seen about his play style and mindset, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs exactly what he does.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: B+

¬†

**Rd 4 pick #104: Dadrion Taylor-Demerson ‚Äì S, Texas Tech University**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If there‚Äôs a player in this draft class that fits the ‚ÄúBudda Baker‚Äù mold, it‚Äôs Dadrion Taylor-Demerson. While he might be undersized (measuring at 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 195 pounds), he‚Äôs a sound tackler who hits like a bag of bricks. He also has a nose for the ball and good hands for a defensive back, and he plays above his size with the impressive ability to take balls away from larger receivers. His versatility and speed will get him snaps as a rookie, as he has the ability to play the nickel position as well as over the top. I love this pick. The Cardinals found a potential future starter in the fourth round who, at the very least, bolsters their depth and versatility on defense.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that Budda Baker is on the tail end of his career, and entering the final year of his contract with the Cardinals. While I‚Äôm in no way suggesting that Taylor-Demerson will replace Budda, it‚Äôs nice to know that Monti and Gannon are considering the future at safety once he eventually moves on.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: A-

¬†

**Rd 5 pick #138: Xavier Thomas ‚Äì EDGE, Clemson University**¬†

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This is an interesting pick from Monti Ossenfort and the Cardinals front office. The Edge position is an area of need that hadn‚Äôt really been addressed this off-season (assuming Darius Robinson plays primarily inside). While Xavier Thomas addresses that issue, to say he‚Äôs had an up and down career up to this point would be an understatement. He came to Clemson as a five star recruit, but a college career plagued with injuries and illnesses meant that he never quite lived up to the hype. His health issues caused weight fluctuations that stifled his production on the field. Partner that with a COVID year, and we‚Äôre looking at a 25-year-old rookie with a six-year stint at the college level. Still, his on-field skills are impressive, and make him a solid value pick at a position of need in the day three of the draft.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Thomas is a twitched up pass rusher who flashes a quick first step and exciting speed to get around the edge and attack quarterbacks. He‚Äôs a rangy defender with a decent ability to shed blocks and make plays against the run. His age and college career might be concerning, but he‚Äôs a good fit for the Cardinals‚Äô scheme under DC Nick Rallis. Also, the Cardinals need as much help as they can get on a defensive unit that ranked near the bottom of the league in sacks last season. At the very least, he‚Äôll come into training camp with a little extra something to prove, which is never a bad thing.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: B-

¬†

**Rd 5 pick #162: Christian Jones ‚Äì OT, University of Texas**¬†

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Christian Jones has the potential to be tremendous value pick for the Cardinals in the latter half of the 5^(th) round. He‚Äôs a durable and versatile player, who started 48 games at both tackle spots for the Longhorns. He‚Äôs a mountain of a man at 6‚Äô5‚Äù, 305 pounds, with a huge wingspan and enormous hands. Jones knows how to utilize his size and strength to bully defenders in the run game. When it comes to pass blocking, his stats are impressive to say the least. According to PFF, Jones allowed only 1 sack, 2 QB hits, and 8 hurries on 511 pass blocking snaps in 2023. He has allowed a 2.6% QB pressure rate since 2021, which ranks 4^(th) best among tackles in college football.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To be quite honest, I have no idea why Christian Jones fell so far down the draft. The only knock I could find from any analyst on his game was a lack of foot speed, athleticism, and technique to keep up with speedy pass rushers. I‚Äôm not sure if that makes sense though, because his pass blocking stats say otherwise. Even Monti Ossenfort told NFL radio that he was surprised to see Jones available at this point in the draft. Maybe it was a lack of competition in the Big 12 that knocked his draft stock down. Although, Alabama defensive end and Buccaneers second round pick, Chris Braswell, claimed that Christian Jones was his toughest matchup in 2023. I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì your guess is as good as mine. It is the fifth round, so temper your expectations, but I think this pick has the potential to be the steal of the draft. At worst, Jones is a depth piece that puts pressure on guys like Kelvin Beachum and Jackson Barton to make the roster in training camp. At best, he‚Äôs a reliable swing tackle that brings size and power to the Cardinals offense.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: A

¬†

**Rd 6 pick #191: Tejhaun Palmer ‚Äì WR, University of Alabama Birmingham**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Cardinals get more receiver depth in the sixth round with Tejhaun Palmer ‚Äì a 6‚Äô2‚Äù, 210 pound prospect out of UAB. He has great size, and a wide catch radius that should translate well to the NFL level. However, he‚Äôll have to work on his foot speed and route running to make the roster and find consistent playing time in the league. There isn‚Äôt much to be said about this pick. Palmer is a depth piece that finds himself at the bottom of a refurbished wide receiver room in Arizona. Although, Blazers receivers have worked out for the Cardinals before (think JJ Nelson). If Palmer impresses in camp and makes the roster, he could find himself on the field if Michael Wilson struggles with injuries again. Nothing wrong with another big target for Kyler Murray.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: B

¬†

**Rd 7 pick #226: Jaden Davis ‚Äì CB, University of Miami**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† With their last pick in the 2024 NFL draft, the Arizona Cardinals add even more depth to a completely overhauled defensive backfield. With four seasons at Oklahoma and one at Miami, Jordan Davis knows what it means to play football on a big stage. However, he failed to make plays on the ball, with only one interception in his college career. He‚Äôs on the smaller side, but he plays with speed, athleticism, and physicality. Again, there isn‚Äôt much to be said about this pick. Davis will likely struggle to make the team unless the Cardinals cornerbacks get hit with the injury bug again (knock on wood). With that in mind, it‚Äôs hard to complain about more cornerback depth for this team.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Grade: C+

¬†

**Conclusion:** 

Grading the NFL draft isn‚Äôt an exact science. Any of these players could turn out to be way better or worse than expected. Until we get to see them put on their pads and compete full speed on Sundays in Glendale, nothing is a sure thing. Even then, things can change quickly in the NFL. That being said, Cardinals fans can take away a few definitive facts from Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon‚Äôs first two off-seasons.¬†

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fact number one: Ossenfort and Gannon have a clear-cut image of the type of players they want on their team. They want guys who play with physicality, intelligence, and passion above all. They want players who demonstrate leadership and maturity both on and off the field. They‚Äôre more than willing to pass up on big names if they‚Äôre players who don‚Äôt fit that mold. Let me put it this way ‚Äì Ossenfort and Gannon want Budda Bakers at every position and every spot on the depth chart. If that doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, then you‚Äôre probably not a Cardinals fan.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fact number two: Monti Ossenfort‚Äôs draft philosophy prioritizes team fit over the best player available. In other words, you won‚Äôt be the ‚Äúbest player available‚Äù in Monti‚Äôs eyes if you don‚Äôt fit the scheme that his coaches like to run. This is one explanation for the back-to-back picks out of the University of Illinois, which I gave the toughest grades out of this year‚Äôs class. Unless you‚Äôre a fan of the Fighting Illini, an NFL scout, or just a grade A sicko, there‚Äôs no way you heard of Isaiah Adams or Tip Reiman before this draft. The bottom line is they‚Äôre great fits for Drew Petzing‚Äôs offense, and that‚Äôs why Monti spent premier draft capital to get them on the team. All things considered, this should be a welcome change for Arizona Cardinals fans. Think about all the times the Cardinals took the ‚Äúbest player available‚Äù or a guy who was ‚Äútoo good to pass up‚Äù only to watch them play the wrong position or just flat out not play for half of their rookie contracts. Thankfully, those years are behind us.¬†

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fact number three: Just to solidify fact number two, Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon draft players who they believe will contribute right away. The cardinals took nine players in the 2023 NFL draft. Eight of those players saw meaningful snaps as rookies, and at least four of them are projected starters in their sophomore seasons. I expect a similar situation with this year‚Äôs class of rookies, as the Cardinals used their draft capital to fill positions of need on both sides of the ball. Out of the twelve players drafted, 8-10 of them should see the field in their rookie seasons.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fact number four: For the first time in 5+ years, the Arizona Cardinals are aligned as an organization. Ownership, the front office, the coaching staff, and the players all have a clear understanding of the direction the team is heading in and the roles they need to play to get there. The previous regime felt like it was attempting to build a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle with a bunch of pieces from different sets. Now it‚Äôs a different story. Bidwill, Ossenfort, and Gannon know exactly what kind of team and culture they‚Äôre building. The players in Arizona have confidence that they fit that picture, because they wouldn‚Äôt be there if they didn‚Äôt.

Overall, it‚Äôs an exciting time to be a Cardinals fan. We have a healthy, motivated Kyler Murray who finally gets a full off-season with his new offense. We have exciting young players on both sides of the ball, and a coaching staff who knows how to get the most out of them. We have leadership in Monti Ossenfort and Jonathan Gannon who are building a competitive and professional brand of football in Arizona. For the first time in a long time, the Cardinals are trending in the right direction.

I‚Äôve been dealing with some emotionally traumatic family issues (mommy issues), for about a year now. It‚Äôs completely rocked my world and has made me feel pretty worthless. I‚Äôve never felt this way before, and I‚Äôve been having a hard time coping. So I made the jump and found a therapist. I only emailed one, she called me back right away, we set up an in person session, and so far she seems pretty cool. 

We had our first session this morning. Initial intake stuff. Asked me about my life and what brings me to therapy. What my goals are‚Ä¶  All the usual stuff that I read about on here before I went in. 

I was able to talk to her pretty easily about my issues with my parents. It felt like talking to a friend. But I will say, it was weird to talk about myself the whole time, when I so badly wanted to say ‚Äúso tell me about you!‚Äù  But I know that‚Äôs not how therapy works. 

The point is, I got through everything fairly easy. I didn‚Äôt really get chocked up, it felt nice to have someone to talk to, and I didn‚Äôt bring too much emotion into it. If anything, I had a smile on my face most of the time and was laughing and joking- do therapists see through that? 

But then when I got back home, I felt really sad. Like more than usual. More than I have been about the situation.  I‚Äôve felt like this all day. Like I want to cry. Almost like the therapy session made me feel worse. She didn‚Äôt say anything negative, if anything she validated my feelings and showed compassion through her facial reactions and body language. 

But now I feel like shit?  Is this how it‚Äôs suppose to feel?  Is it suppose to be hard before it gets easier?  Was I just suppressing my emotions so much that they finally spilled through when I was in the comfort of my own home?  Or did speaking it out loud to a stranger make it more real?

Has anyone felt like this?  Like I said, it‚Äôs my first time ever doing therapy and all this is so new to me, that I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm supposed to to feel. ",05-04-2024,1,0,

However, we all know how these narcissists make us feel isolated and gaslight us into oblivion, so I‚Äôm looking for some validation‚Ä¶

Has anyone been in the position that their abuser is just the most miserable human to be around. Like EVER. Always stressed and self pitying and loathing over absolute shit and self sabotaging decisions THEY have made, when they‚Äôre actually so brilliant and quite capable of NOT making said shit decisions. In making those decisions, they have completely destroyed your life and your children‚Äôs lives, as well. A severe path of destruction and narcissism.

 Their mood is always grumpy, aggressive, condescending etc. (Although, mine would actually drink all night and then sleep the whole day, and leave me to parent the 3 babes by myself, after being up with at least one of them all night. I was lucky, because he would only crawl out of his lair at 1-3 pm, and then start being the grumpy asshole then‚Ä¶ And he was generally a fun drunk. I was almost relieved when he started drinking. He decided he liked us then. I could breathe, but I always knew it was only a few short hours til the hungover narcissistic sociopathic monster emerged once again. 

AND THEN!!!!!! WAIT FOR IT! Waaaaiiiiiit‚Ä¶waaaaaiiiiit‚Ä¶..

THEY DEMAND SEX! Nightly. Like, a TON of sex, nightly. 

Then. You oblige. For years. To keep them from treating you like an even bigger pile of shit, and from neglecting your kids even more. Without realizing, you‚Äôre being sexually coerced and basically sexually abused  FOR YEARS. 

But, then, one day, you find a way to gain some stability in your own convictions and much needed support around you. You decline sex. Every night. For months. He walks around, exposing his pathetic dick to you,every chance he gets, thinking it may, perhaps, entice you to wanna touch it? Even when another family member could easily enter the room, at any given moment? Ew. 

And then these mother effers have the gross audacity to whine and act like a victim, because they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting any affection,‚Äù and they ‚Äúdeserve love, like everyone else..‚Äù Theynwould be ‚Äúso much happier and supportive if they ever got some sex‚Äù Poor him.

Mordhau Demo Mode Commands Archive:,Blankyjae33,1,1cjrot4,Mordhau,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mordhau/comments/1cjrot4/mordhau_demo_mode_commands_archive/,0,"

//FYI, this is not mine, I managed to archive [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mordhau/comments/c35oir/deleted_by_user/) post here which showed all the demo commands before it was deleted. I am just re-uploading.//



<Demo Recording>  


demo.useadaptivereplayupdatefrequency 0

Makes animation playback smoother.

demo.recordhz 120-240

Default is 120, higher number means more fluid demos but will increase space usage.

demorec <demoname>

Records a demo with the specified name.

demostop

Stops recording the demo. Demos also automatically stop when the match ends.

Demos are saved in: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Mordhau\\Saved\\Demos

<Demo Playback>  
demoplay <demo name>  


Plays the specified demo. IMPORTANT Before playing a demo, create a local match, join spectators, then enter the command to play. Failure to do so will result in a locked camera.

demostop

Stops the demo. If you're planning on joining a server to record more footage or just play Mordhau It's highly recommended you just restart the game due to the myriad of bugs that demos introduce with the UI and camera movement.

demopause

Pauses the demo. Enter again to resume playback.

demo.timedilation <x>

Sets playback speed. 1 is real time, 0.5 is half speed, 2 is double speed, etc. Can go as many decimal places as you want. Note that jumping from normal to low speed will cause ragdolls and cloth physics to react as of gravity has been turned off. Suggest you rewind 30-60 seconds before a scene you want to record before lowering speed so that the physics can settle down.

demo.withtimeburnin <1/0>

Adds a timestamp to the upper left corner so that you can take note of events you want to come back to.

demo.gototimeinseconds <x>

Jumps to a point in the video. Use whole seconds, ie 2 minutes = 120.

demo.skiptime <x>

Skips forward in seconds.

<Basic Controls>  
\\\~ (tilde) = Opens and closes console.  


Mouse = Camera control.

WSAD = Forward, back, left, right.

Q / E = Change camera height / z axis.

Left click / right click = Cycle through players in the demo when in first and third person.

Middle mouse = First person / third person orbital / unlock camera.

Up / down while in console = Recall previous commands.

<Advanced Controls>  
I = Opens timeline. Double click buttons to interact with them. Drag the slider to seek through the demo. This will lock camera movement, fress F to close the timeline and regain camera control.  


Mousewheel up/down = Control camera movement speed. CINEMATIC MODE

G = Manually move focus back. CINEMATIC MODE

H = Manually move focus forward. Note that this is currently not working. CINEMATIC MODE

F = Set focus distance to whatever you're looking at.

O = Locks focus to a particular object/person to keep the subject in focus where ever you move the camera.

T = Save camera coordinates.

R = Snap back to the saved camera coordinates.

<Advanced Demo Commands>  
spectatorcmd cinematic  


Switches into a ""cinematic"" view with hidden HUD, tighter FOV, more aggressive motion blur & depth of field, and increases LOD to highest value to make the game look its best. Using this command doesn't change your overall game quality in video settings. To exit cinematic mode, left click once then middle click twice.

spectatorcmd aperture <x>

Sets the aperture of the cinematic camera which controls how aggressive the depth of field is. Lower number means more foreground and background blur with regards to your subject. Higher number means more of the scene will be in focus. This setting seems to bottom out at 1.0 and top out at 22.

spectatorcmd aspectratio <x>

Sets the aspect ratio of cinematic mode. This is expressed as a decimal, but doesn't seem to work properly 4:3 = 1.333, 16:9 = 1.777.

spectatorcmd lens <x>

Sets the field of view while in cinematic mode. 50 = default. Lower number means wider, higher number means more narrow. Too low and you will introduce severe stretching/skewing.

spectatorcmd noclip

Allows you to move the camera through objects without obstruction. Enter the command again to enable clipping.

spectatorcmd focus <x>

Manually set focus distance. Higher number = focus on things farther away. Using command requires a lot of trial and error to get the focus locked on the subject.

m.hidehud 1

Completely hide all hud elements while outside of cinematic mode.

<Tips>  
Use mouse smoothing in control options in conjunction with a low demo.timedilation value to create smooth panning shots with mouse movement.  


To exit demo mode type ""disconnect"" into console.",05-04-2024,1,0,DISCUSSION
Cost of changing adhesive sticker and it's IP68 rating.,hexagon918,1,1cjrot3,GalaxyS20FE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS20FE/comments/1cjrot3/cost_of_changing_adhesive_sticker_and_its_ip68/,0,"If you're reading this. My back panel was loose and I recently fixed it in a samsung service centre.

The sticker cost me around 500 INR. I don't know if I got charged more for this or not. Because I got charged around this much for the adhesive replacement I have some concern about it being genuine.

But most importantly, I'm not confident about the ip68 rating as plastic have a hard time sticking to metal, because the phone's heat loosen it day by day. 

Note: it's kinda funny and a bit concerning at the same time that the packaging for the adhesive tape clearly mentions that it costs around 10INR/kg although it was from samsung India.",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice Needed

Tell the world He is the way

In this quiet hour of worship,

An actual interesting altformat,nazumii8829,1,1cjrosd,Lorcana,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1cjrosd/an_actual_interesting_altformat/,0,"   In just about every TCG community there is a group who constantly try and shoe horn the rules of MtG's commander into the game and it consistently with out fail doesn't work out and is shunned. Id put forward the reason commander clones suck is because they inevitably turn every deck into a bricky clown fiesta style deck that absolutely knee caps the power level, which i contend is both boring and dumb.

   One day after some testing me and my team came up with a fun deck building challenge to determine who was going to buy dinner, thus was born what we call

Maleficent Format

The only change
No color restriction
Standard rules apply as normal. 

   The main reason I want to suggest you give this a shot, is because of how accessible it is. Unlike every other garbage alt format that requires some arbitrary restriction on what cards can be used and some complete new set of asinine rules to learn, maleficent format allows you to jusr use your entire collection to discover new crazy interactions.

I'm not trying to make some massive change in the game or lorcana circle, i like the game as is and have really enjoyed competing and playing, but im tired of seeing people try to redesign a good game to be just bad commander. This instead is just Lorcana but with a fun twist

I feel disappointed in myself,FakeAcc24567,1,1cjros7,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1cjros7/i_feel_disappointed_in_myself/,0,"Today I feel disappointed in myself.

I‚Äôm disappointed in myself because I decided to make fun of a girl that didn‚Äôt deserve it. Trying to hang out and fit in, I did the exact same thing that people did to me when I was younger. I made fun of a girl so I didn‚Äôt kill the vibe. Because the people I was with were having fun. So why kill the vibe? Just laugh and move on. But I know how that feels, so why would I do that? If I‚Äôm being honest, I want someone in the comments to reach out and say ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs fine. You know better now, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up for it.‚Äù But it only took one time for someone to laugh at me for me to be paranoid for any chuckle behind me. I walk around on eggshells awaiting every passing comment to throw some shot at me but I do it to a girl who didn‚Äôt deserve it in the least. I‚Äôm a fucking loser for that. It‚Äôs frustrating for me because I think I move past a point in life where I feel better then, all of a sudden, I regress a bit.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don‚Äôt know what to think of myself anymore. Am I progressing? Am I getting better or worse? Could I forgive myself? But as soon as I thought, ‚ÄúI know better.‚Äù I get lost in the crowd again and abandon my good reasoning for people to like me. This is why I stopped talking to all my friends. I don‚Äôt think they know me. I don‚Äôt think I know me. I‚Äôve never felt truly connected to any of these people, just a mask I put on to let myself believe that. The more I isolate myself, the more I feel connected to me. I figure out the things I like, what I don‚Äôt like, I think clearer, I sympathize more.

I hate how once people see Asa and Denji are in the room they come here to spread their toxin ship 

I hate how Asaden whales says she is the first girl that brought him happiness but forgot Reze and forget how Asa first wants to kill Denji and turn him into a weapon to kill chainsaw man

I hate Asaden whales cuz they disrespect ships such as Denji x Beam that is way better than their ship

I hate how they ignored the fact Denji doesn't give a shit about Asa in the previous chapter and Asa being all simp in that chapter

I hate how they breathe the same air as me please take in carbon dioxide inside but the only thing their smelling is the farts let out by them in their basement

Sales fell down because of the main focus on the ship shoved down our throats by Asaden whales 

We are not also going to withstand slanders about Denji x Beam if their ship does not get slanered too

I have a three-year-old toddler. We\* got diagnosed last year and it's been over a year of OT and six months of ST. He's been such a champ throughout and has made amazing progress. From pulling and pointing when he needs something, he's able to communicate (with words) what he needs and wants. His behavior has also greatly improved over time.

  
I say we because on the consult where he officially got diagnosed, the dev ped pointed out that I was showing signs of autism in adults too and I admitted that I went through the rabbit hole of adult autism videos on Tiktok. He asked a few questions to confirm his suspicion and he did confirm that I was definitely on the spectrum but seemed to be high-functioning.

  
When I was pregnant, I always wished that my son would turn out like me. I wanted him to look like me and be as good in academics as I was but I never really knew or suspected that I was possibly on the spectrum.

  
Despite his progress, there are still some big challenges that we have to deal with. Our current struggle is with him brushing his teeth.

We haven't really been the best at making him do it consistently and we weren't able to wean him off night feeding. This resulted in having him undergo an extensive dental procedure where 10 teeth had to be pulled out and 6 were put in crowns. When the doctors had me pick him up from the procedure room when he was waking up from anesthesia, I was in tears and felt so bad and the recurring thought that popped up in my head was ""Out of all the things that he could get from me, it really had to be autism.""

  
I have thyroid cancer so things aren't really going well for me from a health standpoint. I'm agnostic but out of desperation, I started praying. I said in my prayer, I'm willing to exchange a few years of my life if it means that my son can be well enough for us to be able to take care of him properly without much struggle. 

  
I know this is most likely temporary. Just like how he improved with talking and his other behaviors, we'll probably be able to settle into a good dental hygeine routine soon. I just worry so much about having to wait for it to happen and then it'll be too late again. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Venting/Needs Support

I can understand that they don‚Äôt want student skipping school hence attendance. The problem is teachers (at both my HS and college) always will talk about theirs this one test that‚Äôs worth a huge portion of you grade, if you miss it you fail. And then follow it with stay home when your sick. And then the day of the test theirs a guy with a cough in the back, a guy sneezing with a box of tissues, the guy who just comes for the one class and then leaves because they don‚Äôt feel well. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôve been that person partly because teachers make it so hard to make things up and at the HS theirs ‚Äúroo‚Äù time which is independent work time where the teachers are supposed to make themselves available to help students and make up assignments. Yet they don‚Äôt like using it for that. I‚Äôve came to school wearing a mask with a sore throat and a headache because of how hard it is to make things up. It‚Äôs also hard to call out. My parents need to call out their normally frantically trying to get my little brothers out to school that by the time they call is normally a few minutes before school starts. And then the attendance office says they need more warning or doesn‚Äôt put it as an excused absence, meaning that I get detention. I‚Äôve had to go talk to them about. The reason this bothers me is because I go sick on the day of my math finals, I had to beg my math teacher not to fail me because of it. I don‚Äôt get sick(as in sick enough to not go to school) but when i do I‚Äôm out for a week, throwing up, fever of 104-105, normally trip to the emergency room. It‚Äôs bad. This normally means my parents have to call my doctor office for a note to prove I‚Äôm actually throwing up. And then when I get back half my teachers make me feel bad about it; I‚Äôm sorry that I got sick my bad I‚Äôll make sure it won‚Äôt happen again. My friend has left school early because they‚Äôve felt nauseous and told me that the reason they went to school was because they had a presentation. I‚Äôve had a teacher that failed my presentation grade because I wasn‚Äôt there to present even though I did most of the slides emailed the teacher etc. this dropped my grade almost a full letter grade.

Anyway, I read that in Japan compulsory schooling is only to middle school/jr high. 

So is Furin an accredited high school or is it just a building that was taken over by delinquents and they call it their school but really they mean headquarters/base?

It is not like I do not put in effort, even if I put extra effort into doing a task or a project it ends up not being liked by anyone.

This show desperately needs a Stephanie type character; a strong confrontational older lady who doesn't take crap from no one, puts people in their place, isn't afraid to get physical (Stephanie's slaps were soapy goodness, and I can never forget when Stephanie kicked Eric in the groin). Stephanie was everything a soap opera character should be and it really hasn't been the same since her departure. I think someone like Erika Slezak would be a perfect addition to the show, she was great on OLTL and gave off major Stephanie vibes, she also resembles SF, maybe she could be a long lost relative of Stephanie's who was born out of an affair Stephanie's abusive dad had back in the day? that would be interesting.",05-04-2024,1,0,

Anyways, when I put the RTK back in the ground I turned about 180 degrees so the black stem thing was facing outwards. I was gonna actually map my yard so losing my test zones wasn't a big deal. I was very surprised when I turned everything on that the maps hadn't shifts 180 degrees also. And just to test to make sure, I had Luba cut one of the test sections. 

This is great news for anyone who wants to bring their RTK inside due to bad weather or winter.",05-04-2024,1,0,Idea/Experience Sharing

Or should I buy Suzuki APV? The APVs seem to have a good reputation, but aren't sold in the AU market any more (they fail some emmision standards). 

For the price of 1 HiAce, I could get 2 APVs, which would solve the problem of reliability and used parts. One to drive, the other for spare parts.

*So, what has been added to the pack?* 

Short answer: More of everything. Building mods. Blocks. Farming. QoL.

*The main addition is Nutritional Balance:* a mod that breaks food down into nutritional categories. Gone are the days of living purely off of vault sweets. It awards buffs for keeping all food groups filled and slight debuffs  if a group is forgotten. It's pretty straightforward to keep everything balanced as long as it's not straight up ignored. 

Explore Farmer's Delight and Croptopia (along with other mods) to satisfy your hunger. And don't worry, there are options for those who want a food source to fill all their nutritional needs.

For those interested in steampunk, we have the whole create family:  Steam and Rails, Interiors, Central Kitchen, Encased, Confectionary, and Slice and Dice.

My wife and I have been married 14 years, we have three kids and generally get along great. Our financial situation is not a problem, I work from home and she‚Äôs a stay at home mom. Where I am struggling lately is in the bedroom. We have sex 2-3 times a month, which I would want more but this is where we seemed to land and that seems like a stretch to her even. 

When we first started out we did have sex a little more but then went down to 1/2 times a month. I expressed frustration and the situation is‚Ä¶ better. Where I am struggling is that its just the same old sex. Hardly any kissing, no oral (on either side, I would love to go down), sex only after 9 and normally she has to have a drink or two first and only in bed‚Ä¶ever. 

Is this just normal been ‚Äúmarried for a long time‚Äù behavior. I am starting to think that I want more sexual fun out of life. I don‚Äôt want it to be so important to me but it is, I can‚Äôt help that. I have a high sex drive and want to spice it up. I have tried to communicate this to her but she will just ignore me or tell me to stop talking. 

I guess it‚Äôs not only sex, it‚Äôs any physical touch. She won‚Äôt cuddle, never has. Won‚Äôt kiss any more, can‚Äôt tell you last time we made out. 

I hate to say it because I love her, but I need more. Or am I just being too needy, is there a solution to lower my sex drive? Am I being unreasonable? ",05-04-2024,1,0,

Buttercup has fallen apart,Historical-Shower785,1,1cjrod1,PasswordManager,https://www.reddit.com/r/PasswordManager/comments/1cjrod1/buttercup_has_fallen_apart/,0,"So i‚Äôve been using buttercup password manager for a year or two now. I loved to compatibility of storing passwords on my google drive and the ability to access them on multiple devices like my phone, laptop, and ipad. Lately however, their apps have been breaking consistently, as if they‚Äôre not keeping up with platform updates.

I loved when I could just use the browser extension to access my passwords, and now I need to sync the extension to the actual app version on my laptop. Besides entering the code to sync them every time I boot it up, it‚Äôs been a pain trying to access the bcup file from google since the app auth requests aren‚Äôt up to date with google. This resulted in me having to download the google drive app to ‚Äúmount‚Äù my drive as a virtual disk on my computer, and connect to a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù password database. 

On ios, it‚Äôs much worse. I loved the autofill password feature and the ability to use face id to unlock the database and not enter in the password every time. As of recent, the app has also had severe issues with trying to access the bcup file on my google drive, and consistently throws up developer errors for missing variable values as a result of the app not being supported properly. Before you mention, yes every app version is up to date, and I wish they weren‚Äôt, because it was much better a year ago.

TL;DR buttercup password manager has turned to sh*t and unless they fix it really soon, I can‚Äôt bear to use their free sh*tty software anymore.",05-04-2024,1,0,

Need help paying for animal hospital visit,Buzzy_Beeby,1,1cjroc2,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1cjroc2/need_help_paying_for_animal_hospital_visit/,1,"The other day, I was cleaning my cats' litterboxes‚Äîpretty typical thing to dos for a cat owner. Once I had just about finished cleaning the first box, my eldest cat, Chili, went into one of the other litterboxes that I had not yet cleaned. As I finished my first one, I went onto clean that one‚Äîexcept I noticed blood on fresh poop, along with some left on her butt.

Due to this, my mother will be taking me to an animal hospital first thing tomorrow, however money is tight at the moment due to my father recently not being able to work anymore, as he's getting older and how much physical stress he has put on his body over time. He is applying for disability at the moment, so hopefully once he does get disability money won't be as tight as it is now. My mother is disabled as well and cannot work; she is on disability and food stamps. As for me, I am currently trying to get services + disability for my autism + other disabilities with the help of my therapist.

Anything will absolutely help, I just want my cat to be healthy and OK; she helps me feel calm, less anxious, and she helps me sleep as night as well, and when I cry she always tries to cheer me up with a ""mrrp?"".

I unfortunately cannot pin an amount, but I know it can be around a couple hundred to 1k for vet stuff; hopefully I'll know once I go. Hoping they accept payment plans as well. I will edit this when I get an exact number (if it is allowed, otherwise I'll mention it in comments).

Opposing PMC Faction AI,lurklord_,1,1cjrobe,GrayZoneWarfare,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrayZoneWarfare/comments/1cjrobe/opposing_pmc_faction_ai/,0,"As enjoyable as engaging in skirmishes with scavs may be, I believe enhancing the PvE experience to better cater to players' preferences and stand out is imperative. Currently, the PvE system operates with all three factions comprising roughly 10 players each, all connecting to the same server. However, with PvP disabled and player locations not displayed on the map, this setup feels like a missed opportunity and strains server resources unnecessarily.

In my view, a more sensible approach would involve individual servers for each faction, with AI PMCs filling the roles of the other two factions throughout the game world. Admittedly, this proposition isn't feasible at present and may not be until development bandwidth is freed up. Nevertheless, such a shift could address the perceived lack of dynamism within the game world.

Under this model, players would need to remain alert to the presence of helicopters flying overhead or touching down nearby during PvE encounters. Additionally, AI PMCs could be programmed to roam the environment much like human players, injecting a sense of unpredictability and realism into the PvE experience.

Basically, adding AI PMCs would allow for a lot more of an ""alive"" world that feels more threatening than it does currently.",05-04-2024,1,0,üí≠ | Thoughts & Feedback

Before I start taking things apart, I'm looking for people that may have had similar symptoms. My 2012 TTS is making an obnoxious metallic tapping noise starting above 2k rpm. The sound is loud enough to be heard in a closed cabin at 60mph and seems to be coming from cylinder 2 or 3 under the valve cover, or possibly the pcv cover. Other symptoms include an intermittent CEL with 02 sensor codes and an occasional stall when coming to a stop (though this has only happened with the AC on so far). 

I suspect this could be a broken valve spring or failing lifter. I will be taking the valve cover off in the next few days when I have time to check the valve train. I'm curious if a failing injector will make such a loud and consistent tapping when failing or if there is a common failure I'm missing from scouring forums.

I'm not sure if this will work for everyone, just going to share my experience with a Galaxy S10 that used to be able to run the game, then couldnt with the update. 

I initially would only get a white screen or compete crash immediately, was super salty about it until I found a tip from another game forum that had similar issues. 

I CAN'T promise it'll work, but I'll list the steps below of what I did

* Make sure game is downloaded
* Enable developer options by going to system info, tapping the build number like 10 times
* Download Android System Webview Dev from Play Store
* Opened app, it told me to make it the default 
* Because my phone has Secure Folder, the option to switch was grayed out.
* Entered secure folder, add the app (on bottom but can search for it and add)
* Open the app, click on prompt, successfully changed the Dev Tools one the default
* Restart the phone
* Wait a weird amount of time for phone startup 
* Open game and also wait a weird amount of time. Instead of the white screen I got a background. I thought it was frozen, but it was actually loading. It might take a few minutes
* Title screen pops up and gives you the option to do the pre-rendering thing, do it
* After a few minutes, slowly lose hope as the game seems to reset 
* Wait to get to title screen again and click settings. You'll notice that the game actually completed the pre-rendering.
* Since my phone is old, I turned the settings down from epic to medium, but you can tweak it to see if it'll work

Bonus: I personally hate the d-pad follow option, which is enabled by default. You may have a better time disabling it, although I would give both to try to see how you feel

There are 5 parts total. 2 minute section, Math, and coding. And then 2 reading comprehension. 

For the coding portion it wasn't anything like I was expecting when I read through old posts on this sub. I didnt have to write any code or pseudo code. It was just multiple choice questions. If you took coding courses in college I think you can get by. No leetcode or anything like that. No arrays, no algorithms. 

For the math portion it's a lot of wordy type of math problems. 

2 minute section is a mix of word problems, and math. I didnt get through it all so I dont remember most of it tbh. 

By the time I got to the reading part I was pretty drained by the whole test ngl. Some of the English stuff was kinda easy where it's like ""based off \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_, is this true?"" type questions. 

Everyone was pretty much right. Theres not much you can do to prepare you for the skills assessment. I dont even think the SAT can help much lol. I think it was pretty hard overall.

I always felt like I deserved nothing until I'm satisfied with myself,Gen_Bloodhorn,1,1cjro1l,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cjro1l/i_always_felt_like_i_deserved_nothing_until_im/,0,"As the title suggests, I find it weird that I feel like I'm the only person who feels like this.  
I feel the need to be better than who I was and reach this metaphorical bar first before I know I deserve a thing. I never even dated once before I got a decent paying job, a somewhat successfully growing career, good friends that I can trust, be presentable enough, and have a realistic and achievable plan for the future.

But now I left my job, and a new career is waiting for me next month. I'm just waiting for that to start; But there's this feeling of not deserving to find a partner, not deserving of finding genuine fun, and this self torture of wasting time away not doing anything (still taking care of myself in health and hygiene btw).

I guess I just want to be proud of myself first, and having been alone for quite some time in my life before made me think this- That I need strong validation from myself that I'm great or I don't deserve someone or something great. Why would I settle for less if I wouldn't even settle for me if I was in someone else's shoes? That I've placed a standard to who I need to be, in high regards.

I think this way of thinking has really improved my skills and my self image a lot; but it also hindered myself from doing so much more.

Is it odd to think and feel this way? I know I have been like this since my mid-teens, and I'm only turning 25 soon.",05-04-2024,1,0,Opinion / Thoughts

Realisticaly speaking, SONY won't do jack-shit. They already got the money, most of you most likely have already played tens if not hundreds of hrs. This is a completely different situation from Tarkov where only a small percentage of the players are affected. Why would a multi-billion company care the small percentage of it's customers? The most of us that are not affected will keep on playing and enjoy the game. Sorry if I sound like a jack-ass but this is the harsh reality.

Honestly speaking, HD2 should have not been available for purchase in regions that won't allow creating a PSN account. I'm not sure if AH is at fault here but SONY definitely should have requested a region block or something like that.

The only positive thing is, the game isn't from a AAAA game studio which would have cost close to $100.",05-04-2024,1,0,OPINION

When doing neutering, will that calm the cat down from this? This black cat seems like it wants to be friendly to humans but other cats that hiss at it, it comes to them and also doesn't seem to know boundaries.

Hoping to get some insight from those that have tried filler before. I‚Äôve been going back and forth for years and have decided to finally give it a go and see if I like it. So much of my life has been spent avoiding cameras and honestly trying to avoid anyone seeing me from the side (yes, impossible üòÖ) I have a pretty recessed chin and seemingly no jawline at all so would be doing that area. This has been prompted now as I‚Äôm travelling at the end of the month and for once in my life would to be in some pictures and not duck away anytime a camera comes out (also going with a tour group that I know posts a decent amount of pictures/video of trips which feels mildly stressful).

So my question is‚Ä¶have a left it too late before I leave to do it? I leave May 27 and the soonest I can get an appointment with the injector I want is May 9. I‚Äôm torn between this is my chance to finally have an experience with a bit more confidence and this is a horrible idea doing it so soon before.

Basically, before I met her I was friends with this girl (let's call her Ash) and we used to flirt a lot. There were no signs of any relationship and since we both had gone through a breakup, her and I used to flirt all the time. 

My girlfriend recently went away on a trip through a social channel and Ash was there as well. I don't like talking about my past at all and Ash revealed everything that happened between us to my girlfriend. The texts etc. my girlfriend confronted me about this, but in my effort to leave the past in the gray, I denied everything. She kept asking and I kept denying or changing the topic. I figured she found out and then I eventually came clean about some things. 

I left that part of my life in the past for a reason and I didn't like talking about it at all. My girlfriend used the quote 'once a liar, always a liar' and I am afraid she will leave. She even went as far as saying that she doesn't even believe that my feelings are true for her. She said she needs time to think about it.

It was nearly midday when Verrick stumbled out the door, still shaking the fog from his sleep addled brain. Looking down over the railing to the street below, he saw his companions leaving the general store nearby, bundles of food in their arms. He waved and made his way down the stairs to the alleyway, hungry and eager to meet up with the rest of the group.

‚ÄúFinally awake?‚Äù Jeron asked, tucking some of the supplies into his pack. ‚ÄúWe were just debating on whether we should leave town while you were sleeping.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery funny,‚Äù Verrick retorted. ‚ÄúWe both know you wouldn't do that. You need someone small to get things out of tight places, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did mention that,‚Äù Fulmara said, stretching her shoulder, ‚Äúbut they said I could just smash stuff for the same result.‚Äù

A smirk crept across her face. ‚ÄúI *do* like that idea.‚Äù

The halfling shook his head. Glancing down the street, he saw the door to the apothecary open, and the doctor and his assistant stepped out into the light. The tall dragonborn took off a pair of thick goggles and rubbed her eyes, blinking in the noon sun.

‚ÄúI need to go do something,‚Äù Verrick called over his shoulder as he started wandering down the road. ‚ÄúI'll be back in a bit.‚Äù

He hurried as he saw the two turning back to their door, and called for the doctor's attention. The elderly gnome turned and waved, holding the door for Verrick.

‚ÄúAh, good! You survived! Quickly, come inside, out of the chill. My old bones don't mind the cold on occasion, but I can feel the snows coming.‚Äù

Verrick followed the two into the storefront, which was now brightly lit and warm. The doctor took a seat in a comfortable chair and gestured for the young rogue to sit across from him. The man's assistant busied herself by the fire, placing dried leaves into a kettle before filling it with water.

‚ÄúNow, I saw the rest of your group down the street just now, so I'll assume you've all survived, but that doesn't tell me much else. So how did it go?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo major injuries,‚Äù Verrick said, trying to figure out how to ask his question. ‚ÄúFulmara, the dwarven woman, that is, was bitten near the end of the fight, and we had to use your potion.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you? How well did it work? She's up and about now, but was that the potion, or her own abilities?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe potion worked wonders,‚Äù Verrick confirmed. ‚ÄúThe venom froze her stiff, but it had her back up on her feet in seconds. Overall, there were three of them, and a nest. We killed them all and burned the nest, so they won't be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent! I'll have to make some more of that batch. Lathira, what batch was that?‚Äù

The assistant, Lathira, scratched her chin. ‚ÄúThat was the Maldiin Mobility Potion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou didn't have the serpent vine extract for that one, though, and had to substitute giant grey toad slime instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm... Make sure we write down the alteration to the recipe. I believe there were a few interactions in the ingredients that made it more potent than we anticipated.‚Äù

The kettle began to steam, and Verrick could hear the water inside beginning to boil.

‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYou just did,‚Äù the gnome said, smiling, ‚Äúbut I suppose a few more questions wouldn't hurt. Go ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave we met before? Before yesterday, that is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù the older man muttered, studying Verrick's face. ‚ÄúWhat was your name, again?‚Äù

‚ÄúVerrick Dustfoot.‚Äù

The gnome's eyes lit up. ‚ÄúDustfoot? Yes, I remember now. Your father was a colleague of mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew my father?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my, yes. He spent many years as a physician for a lesser noble, where I first met him. He actually taught me a few things, back in the day.""

""So that was where we met?"" Verrick asked.

""No, that was after his time in the court. He brought you through town once, fifteen or twenty years ago. I haven't seen him in almost as long. How has he been?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe disappeared not long after,‚Äù Verrick confirmed. I haven't heard from him since I was a child.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me see... He brought you through, said you were moving to a new home, a small town a few days rimward. Then he came back through alone almost a year later. He never said where he was going, but he had enough equipment on him to start several apothecaries. That was the last I saw him.‚Äù

Verrick ran his hand through his hair. It wasn't much, but it was more than he'd ever had. The people of Stony Creek hadn't known where his father had gone, or even why he had left the town. Now, at least, Verrick had something he could work with.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said, standing. ‚ÄúI never knew what happened to him. I might be a bit closer to finding out. Do you remember who he served in the court?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately not, but that information won't help you anyway. The entire kingdom was razed by the elves sixty years ago for defiling their woodlands with blood magic. You'll not find anyone left there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see. Still, this might help find him. Thank you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, of course! If you *do* find him, please tell him to come and visit again. I very much enjoyed our chats back in the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù Verrick agreed. ‚ÄúAfter I tear him a new one for abandoning me.‚Äù

The kettle began to whistle, prompting Verrick to turn. ‚ÄúI should be going. We still need to report to the elder, and we should probably be leaving town today if the snows are coming soon.‚Äù

------------

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the elder asked as the party closed the door, shutting out the chill. ‚ÄúCome to demand supplies? Want me to talk about which of my neighbors I think it is?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came to tell you the problem is dealt with,‚Äù Jeron said. ‚ÄúYou had a ghoul burrow under the big oak in the graveyard. We killed all three of them, and burned the nest. They won't be bothering you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat so? Then you have nothing left here for you, so go.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Firun said, his eyes glowing as he stepped forward, ‚ÄúI've had just about enough of this. Your pride and petty suspicions almost got you and your little militia killed. How many of them have actually been trained to fight? How many of them would've even *guessed* that these were ghouls, instead of a person? No, you wouldn't have survived, and you wouldn't have even taken the ghouls out with you, and by the time more help could arrive, how many more would have died as a result of your stubbornness?

‚ÄúYou almost brought your town to ruin because you didn't want to let outsiders deal with something that you didn't even understand. These people put their trust in you when they allowed you to lead them. What do you think will happen when they realize how badly their trust was misplaced?‚Äù

His anger was interrupted by Verrick stamping out the flames that had begun gathering at his feet. The half elf took a deep breath, forcing his magic to calm, to return to the smoldering embers that normally filled his soul. At length, he opened his eyes, and regarded the man who sat before him.

‚ÄúI've seen your kind before,‚Äù he said, an icy bite creeping into his voice. ‚ÄúYou all, inevitably, lead your people to ruin. Step down before it comes to that.‚Äù

Firun turned and walked away, and a cold wind blew into the room as he left, chilling the rest of the group.

‚ÄúI'm going to talk to him,‚Äù Jeron said. He turned back at the door and regarded the scorched section of floor. ‚ÄúRemember this, every time you see that. He is absolutely right. You almost got everyone killed for nothing.‚Äù

Jeron closed the door and returned to the street, where he found Firun watching the townsfolk as they went about their daily lives. He let out a long, slow breath and watched the fog as it quickly dissipated. Finally, the half elf turned to face him.

‚ÄúWant to explain what happened? I've heard hundreds of stories of sorcerers before, and not once did they mention accidentally burning down buildings. Not more than once, anyway.‚Äù

Firun sighed. ‚ÄúMy powers are a blessing and a curse. When I'm calm and centered, they're like a warm hearth, hot to the touch but useful. When it boils over, though...‚Äù

He gestured at the building. ‚ÄúI can suppress them to some extent, but they seem to want to rampage, to burn out of control. I don't know why, but they feel alive, like they're trying to escape. It's part of why I'm traveling. I need to find a way to control them, or get rid of them entirely.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know a couple meditation techniques, if that might help.‚Äù

The half elf sighed and scratched his head, still regrowing hair from their first meeting. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. Like I said, my powers almost feel alive at times, and they *want* to burn things. They heighten my emotions, which makes them stronger, and eventually, they erode my self control enough that they can leak out.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there a way to snap you out of it when that happens?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou saw it just now. Any distraction will help. As long as I can't focus on any one person, or thing, I can usually bring everything back down. You just have to break my line of thought.‚Äù

Jeron nodded, as the rest of the group emerged from the building. ‚ÄúRight, if Firun catches fire when we don't want him to, someone slap him.‚Äù

The sorcerer smiled. ‚ÄúThat would work, though I hope you'll find a less painful way. I'm not really a fan of being hit.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody is,‚Äù Verrick chimed in.

‚Äú*Most* people aren't,‚Äù Jeron corrected. ‚ÄúSome real freaks in the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúRyn'Ala?‚Äù Fulmara asked, smirking.

Jeron shuddered. ‚ÄúShe's like a mother to me. I don't need that mental image.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù Verrick asked. ‚ÄúWe need to head back to Norgham and get our payment from the guards, but what do we do after?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever we want,‚Äù Firun said. ‚ÄúWe have nothing tying us down. We can travel, or take more work in the city, or stay and learn some new skills.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt some point soon,‚Äù Jeron offered, ‚Äúwe should have a specialist talk to you, and find a way to help control your magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have someone in mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of Ryn'Ala's friends. He's as much an expert on the arcane as anyone could be, and he's going to be studying the Egg in the future, so he'll be in town for a while.‚Äù

The half elf nodded. ‚ÄúAny other suggestions? I don't know his procedure, but I doubt it'll take all that long for him to get the information he needs. I'm not *that* old yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf nobody else has anything,‚Äù Verrick commented, ‚ÄúI may have something. My father disappeared when I was a child, and the doctor in town here remembered meeting him once after that. I don't have much information, but I know he passed through here with a ton of alchemical equipment.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long ago?‚Äù Jeron questioned. ‚ÄúThere's always a need for doctors and alchemists, but they don't exactly carry a ton of supplies with them unless they expect to need it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe vanished almost twenty years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat gives us a decent lead to find him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you'll help?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Fulmara confirmed. ‚ÄúWe help each other, and make each other stronger.‚Äù

Firun nodded. ‚ÄúI'd like to see about getting *some* level of control first, but I'll help too. It wouldn't exactly do to find your father only to burn something down in celebration.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Jeron agreed, ‚Äúwe should probably put that near the top of the list. But there's some research that we can do while that's going on, and someone needs to teach Verrick to read.‚Äù

Fulmara raised her hand sheepishly. ‚ÄúI'm not particularly good at reading either. I can get the small words down, but the big ones take some time. If you wouldn't mind, could you teach me too, once you get to that part?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll do it,‚Äù Firun volunteered. ‚ÄúYou probably know best where to find any of the information we need, and I'd rather do something to help when I'm not being studied.‚Äù

The four agreed, and began their march back to the trade city and their temporary home. As the sun lowered toward the duskward rim, they made camp beneath the guarding boughs of the forest, and Firun prepared a simple dinner. Late that night, as Verrick stood watch, the first flakes of snow hissed as they struck the glowing embers of their fire, and for the first time he could remember, the young halfling found himself enjoying the sight of snow.

Bad parenting ,pocketmuck,1,1cjrnxe,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1cjrnxe/bad_parenting/,0,"Bad parenting

My gf just told me that her sister was going through her kids phone and then sent some of the texts from that phone to my gf laughing about it. If they told me that shit id tell them that was dumb and they just ruined the trust they had left with their daughter. Also she's like 13 or something and possibly has nudes and shit because teens are figuring out their bodies. So that's kinda fucked up that they would even wanna look in her phone. I would never do that to my kid. That would make her afraid to be herself even on her phone where she should feel free to express herself. It's not even my family and I'm pissed about it maybe it's the freedom mushrooms make me want but I can't stand that. It's in another level of shitty parenting. They have cameras in the house too. How could you ever feel free to be yourself when someone could always be watching. Especially when your a kid and not fully comfortable with yourself yet. They are super religious too. They have another daughter that hit puberty way early at like 7 (I think from being molested) and the hormones made her have nightmares which they knew because of doctors lol but I guess one night when she was talking in her sleep her dad walked in and started yelling bible verses trying to expel a demon. Not my kids, not my family but I can't help but feel bad and also mad because it just can't be right. I think if it's because they are worried about sexual assault from online dudes then they should either press her on cyber safety or just not let her have a phone.

She was an amazing home cook who did what I can only describe as a hungarian-jewish-american fusion. One night it might be classic american meatloaf, the next an americanized chicken paprikash, the next a juicy and tender braised brisket.

One of my favorites was her batter fried fish. It was a fluffy whitefish of some sort, but the batter is what really stumps me. When fried up, the breading was sort of chewy and crispy. It would often separare a bit from the fish, and it was crispy like most fried food, but if you bent it it wouldn't shatter, but bend. The only batter recipes I know produce glassy and crispy breading. That's good, but not exactly bringing flashbacks of my childhood.

I remember seeing her batter the fish. The batter looked pretty thick and goopy, but smooth.

One thing to note is that at the time I was allergic to eggs and milk, so those were definitely not ingredients in the batter.",05-04-2024,1,0,Recipe Request

My question is, will my PSU support it? I know the 980 is much better performance wise but I am not sure if my PSU is good enough, the research I made has mixed results honestly, some say it's fine and others say it could be risky in the long run, which is why the 1050ti would be the safer choice. 

I don't have the budget for a PSU upgrade sadly.

It takes a while for it to heat up to 400. I remember i used to turn it on high when i first got it and it would be 500-600 even after 10 minutes.

When cooking a juicy burger the fat from the burger drips on the heat plate shield but does ignite. Theres never any fire on my grill for some reason. I've cleaned it, changed gas tanks, played around with every component I can think of. Even did the whole trick where people say to slowly open the gas valve on the propane tank... notthing.

To do that, we need a group effort. Me and JuicyLegend invite you to come visit the wiki, and help grow it.

You are free to edit and create pages for lostwaves.org, but please do the following:

1. Only talk about relevant things. Irrelevant posts and edits will be removed 

**Example: Do not add information about lostwaves that do not have any prominence.**

All articles must be lostwaves that @user-QLostwave has uploaded to YouTube - it‚Äôs a dumb rule, but this is the criteria we‚Äôre implementing for notability, because there really is no way to measure notability of a lostwave.

2. Ensure your information is accurate, verifiable, and up-to-date.

**Example: Don‚Äôt promote unverified theories of how Jitomate Triste was banned.**

A good idea is to base your articles and edits off of YouTube documentaries of the song.

3. Do not talk about things subjectively. You must be objective and neutral.

**Example: ‚ÄúWaste my time is the best lostwave ever!‚Äù (it is, but we still strive to be neutral)**

4. Be nice

**Example: Edit wars, removing parts of an article for no reason**

Since the customer was in the area for a couple of other sales, we met at a public spot, I gave him the pack, and he paypal'd me the money.

Flash forward a month, and I get a dispute notice on Paypal from the guy, claiming that I never fulfilled the transaction. I messaged him asking wtf, he said he must've accidentally disputed the wrong charge and said he'd cancel it, and just ghosted me. Eventually, the dispute was escalated to paypal, which is where things started getting frustrating:

Now, because I met him outside of a Police Station, I was actually able to reach out to them so they can give the CCTV footage of the transaction to Paypal. Furthermore, because this guy's one of those small timey streamers that opens packs and sells the contents to his fans, I actually have footage of him opening the booster pack, as well as screenshots of his ebay where he sold the individual cards.

So given all of that evidence I had, I was under the impression that this was going to be an open and shut case. However, since the dispute was escalated to a claim, the resolution date has changed 3 times since the original date.

Furthermore, what's frustrating me is the buyer just outright hasn't said anything either to me or paypal during this process.

I'm Lost... Weird Layer Starts,Alone-heh,1,1cjrmyz,FixMyPrint,https://www.reddit.com/r/FixMyPrint/comments/1cjrmyz/im_lost_weird_layer_starts/,1,"Been printing 2 years now and never came across a problem like this nor have I seen anyone with a similar problem. I went from printing with PETG, TPU, and ABS back to PLA, and when I did, I was greeted with this mess. Printer is an Ender 3 V2 with a .8 nozzle, CR Touch, and Overture filament running off of Cura. Tried scanning the internet for any similar issues and was unsuccessful. Also tried all the stuff I have listed below. Honestly wondering if I need to replace the existing 4.2.7 motherboard with a new one at this point because I have failed to find anything mechanically wrong and it feels like I am running out of Cura settings to play with.

List of things I have tried (roughly in order):

* Changed nozzle
* Cold pull
* Change of line width
* Temp tower and adjust
* Flow tower and adjust
* Lower wall print speed
* Lower overall print speed
* Print retraction tower (speed and distance) and adjust
* Messed with ""Retraction extra prime amount"" (a LOT)
* Messed with fan speed (even disabling cooling at one point)
* Lowered jerk speed for extruder
* Lowered acceleration speed for extruder 
* Lowered wall jerk
* Lowered wall acceleration
* Changed extruder gear
* Made sure extruder stepper shaft was straight
* Tightened belts
* Checked for loose belt drives
* Checked for loose wire connections
* Inspected motherboard, checking every connection
* Tightened every structural bolt on the machine
* Made sure filament guides and filament roller were freely moving
* Tried changing ""z seam alignment""
* Made sure there were no flat spots in any wheels / rollers
* Made a new PLA file from scratch

Things you may ask:

Is the filament wet? - Never in my 3d printing experience have I had any issues with wet PLA, and these are not nearly consistent with prints I've had that were wet.

Did you try changing the filament? - Yes. I switched to a roll of a different red Overture PLA that I've printed fine with before, and the issue was the same.

Why did you buy a Creality product? - Sometimes I wonder the same.

Possible microstepping issue? - Same layer height that I've always used.

ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED - I have been fighting this battle for over a week now with the projects piling up and even if you think your suggestion is crazy or I've tried some version of it already I will take anything. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to help.

  
TLDR; Weird issue I can't figure out, I tried everything I know or could find, and any help is appreciated.

In contrast, my 32"" sony lcd I bought just out of highschool (2006) works flawlessly and my wife's almost equally old Samsung also works flawlessly. Both via an older 1080p Chromecast. 

Game mode helps but still has some minor stuttering. Tried changing trumotion on/off and various levels, BFI gives me a headache as I notice the flicker. My computer monitor has no issue displaying F1, it's only my fanciest tv that struggles with this sport.

No other content has noticeable stuttering, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon all play fine. Games on switch and steam link on a low power pc work great.

AITA for being upset at my friend for not including us in her prom plans?,lawlessundoing,1,1cjrmxa,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cjrmxa/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_friend_for_not/,0,"
Hello, me and my friends were planning to go with each other to senior prom as none of us have dates.

I originally didn‚Äôt even want to go but my only two friends who were going said I should that we would all be together and have a good time. Prom tickets are expensive where I am so this was a big deal. That‚Äôs why the other people in our friend group aren‚Äôt going. (We‚Äôre all a pretty close knit friend group. We‚Äôre all best friends)

We all talked about going together but we had a lot of finals, tests, and extracurriculars roll around and specific plans (whose driving ((prom is 1 1/2 hours away in a busy city with awful traffic)), where are we going to eat/take pictures put on the back burner.) None of us are allowed to drive because it‚Äôs a wreck prone area and none of our parents want to take that risk. So we were trying to find a ride with hopefully a more experienced driver.  

Well, 3 weeks before prom comes around and I text my group chat of my only two friends going and asked if they wanted to get together and talk about plans. One friend, we will call her Beth, says she already has a ride. I immediately said I was under the impression that we were going together. She didn‚Äôt respond so I asked about it later in class that day. She said she would rather talk in person, so I asked and she said she was going with her other friend and that friend‚Äôs boyfriend. That we can meet up at the prom and have fun. Now, I don‚Äôt hang around this friend much as I used to date a friend of hers and it‚Äôs just a little awkward. I wouldn‚Äôt really mind going with her, but the other friend in the group chat doesn‚Äôt know her boyfriend at all so it would be weird for her. 

So, I asked why she didn‚Äôt tell us. She said she forgot. Which I don‚Äôt understand why she didn‚Äôt just tell us the moment she decided to go with them, but I‚Äôll elaborate on this in just a second. 

I was kinda getting angry and I really didn‚Äôt want to say anything mean out of that anger so I bit my tongue and just said, ‚ÄúI hope me and (other friend, I‚Äôll call her Kate) find a ride then.‚Äù

Now, I went and talked to Kate and asked if I was unreasonable for being hurt by this change in events. So close to prom it felt like she was leaving us to find a ride on our own, when I wanted us to all ride together. Because it‚Äôs not just the ride, it‚Äôs the pictures it‚Äôs getting dinner. It‚Äôs our last ever opportunity to do this and I wanted it to be with the people I consider my best friends. 

Kate said I wasn‚Äôt being unreasonable and she was also angry about the blindside, but was just going to sweep it under the rug for the sake of peace. 

I disagreed, but I also didn‚Äôt feel like confrontation was the right answer at the moment because we have this show in two days. And practices leading up. This show is important to Beth and I really didn‚Äôt want to throw her off kilter. I kind of avoided her, which may have been petty. I was hurt, I wasn‚Äôt ready to talk about it, and I didn‚Äôt want to start something. She noticed this, but never tried to start a conversation with me about it. 

The show passes and two days of finals and stress after that. I was driving home and realized holding on to this anger is hurting people and those around me. So I decide I need to text her and tell her how I feel so we can work on repairing our relationship. She‚Äôs more of the talk in person type, which I understand. But I like to text because it‚Äôs the easiest way to get my thoughts out coherently. I stammer and lose my train of thought when nervous and can‚Äôt communicate what exactly I need too. 

I tell her she hurt me. I told her I‚Äôve been angry the past few days and I have been putting off telling her because we have all been so busy and I wanted to wait until the right time so I can gather my thoughts and communicate my feelings clearly. I said she hurt me by choosing to go with other friend and her boyfriend. I said I felt blindsided because I thought we were going to make plans together. Instead of us all coming to a conclusion together, you jumped at the first opportunity and we felt left in the dust to scramble for one. I said it felt like a choice between friend and her boyfriend and me and Kate and she chose friend and her boyfriend. 

We also went with this group last year and they always like to leave early, so I didn‚Äôt understand why she chose to go with them instead of me and Kate. Me and Kate are her best friends, what about going with us was so bad.

She ignored the message for hours. 

Then she sent something to the prom gc and said we could meet up for food before and try to work something out.

I said I appreciate her trying to include us now, but why just now. I asked if inviting me and Kate was the plan all along(I knew it wasn‚Äôt because when I said I guess me and Kate need to find a ride then she just nodded) That‚Äôs why we were upset. Because we were left out to find something ourselves. 

I said I appreciate her trying to accommodate but my initial hurt is still there because we weren‚Äôt in your plans originally. 

Half an hour passes and I start playing some games with Kate and another friend. I‚Äôm on call with them and Beth calls. We were in the middle of the game, and we had been trying to get together to play it for a while. This other friend knows nothing about the prom drama going on, because I would never gossip about my friends to one another if it isn‚Äôt any of their business. So I can‚Äôt just leave the call immediately. I kinda cut the game short though and call back when we got to a stopping point 15 ish minutes later. 


I answer the call and she is sobbing and immediately started saying I was assuming things about her character. That she didn‚Äôt choose them over us. That I really hurt her assuming those things and she can‚Äôt believe it. 

I calmly said I didn‚Äôt say anything about your character. I just said how your actions made me feel. I also said my other friend felt the same way. When I said that she said I talked to everyone about this but her. I said I just talked to my mom and friend. 

She said I shouldn‚Äôt have let it fester so long, i explained my reasoning up above. She said I hurt her by ignoring her all week instead of just talking about it. I said I knew the show was important to her and didn‚Äôt want to throw her off. 

She said that she didn‚Äôt tell me the plans because she forgot. She said that she always tries to make sure everyone is involved and never leaves anyone out and I shouldn‚Äôt assume she was doing that. Yet again, I said not an assumption on your character. I‚Äôm only saying how you made me and Kate feel. That was left out, and blindsided. 

I said my reason for sending that apparently accusatory text (it was littered with ‚Äúthis made me feel blank‚Äù or ‚Äúi felt blank‚Äù when this happened) was to give her opportunity to offer insight on her actions because I genuinely didn‚Äôt understand.

Eventually, she apologized for hurting me. She didn‚Äôt apologize for her actions so I don‚Äôt think she was wrong. I apologized for hurting her. We hung up and I hope it is settled.

The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is how this conversation started with and revolved around me hurting her. When the initial problem was she hurt me. By expressing my feelings and how her actions caused me pain, I was the bad guy who was tearing her down and accusing her of these awful things.

Sorry this was so long and to bore you with teenage drama. But I really want to know, am I the jerk in this situation. I talked to Kate after the call with Beth and just started crying. I described the call and how awful I felt alter how I went in hoping to close this situation but got told basically how awful I was for allowing these actions to hurt me. 

Maybe I am just being too sensitive. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice Needed

Weird illness possible long Covid ,DeathclawTacos,1,1cjrmtc,covidlonghaulers,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1cjrmtc/weird_illness_possible_long_covid/,0,"I posted this elsewhere and someone suggested I post here because they felt my symptoms may be long covid so wanted to see if anyone could shed light on this because I‚Äôm so flustered and tired: 


I am a 40m 270lbs and after what I thought was a prolonged sinus infection May/June of 2023 I developed weird symptoms roughly a month after it cleared but doctors don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. My vitals are good, in fact my high blood pressure (pre-hypertension levels) seems to be more normal, which sounds good but is weird because even at my healthiest my BP hovered 135/85 on average, but now is considered healthy 120/70 range. My sleep study came back normal, with no signs of bradycardia or apnea as my cardiologist originally thought, avg heart rate was 65bpm and O2 was high. Stress test/echo was good and blood work come back sorta ok. Bedside CBC from an ER visit was: Cell HGB 24.1, mean cell volume 74fL, red blood cell 6M/uL and RDW 17% (non fasting) were the only things off last time. My ALT is high too, 80‚Äôs is where it usually hovers. Thyroid was normal range. Have only had BP monitored while sitting down, no tilt tests or anything else. 

Symptoms: exercise intolerance that comes and goes, heat intolerance which exacerbates the exercise intolerance. When I have an episode I feel like I‚Äôm having a panic attack, I get shaky, woozy feel like I‚Äôm going to faint and have to stop. It only happens if I go sorta heavy but nowhere near my max PRs, but the extra weirdness is it is worse if I do pull exercises, carry free weights/plates or if the exercise requires movement below my midsection (like row, glute push, or bending over to pick up handles for low cable fly). Cardio had to be wound down a lot, I used to be able to do an hour on the elliptical with a heart rate of 145-160bpm, now I do the recumbent bike and average 125-132bpm. They are the main points of what is going on. I do have GERD if that is a helpful side note. 

While I know I likely can‚Äôt get a diagnosis maybe knowing questions I can ask or additional tests I can push for would be helpful because I would love to start working out the same way I used to. I‚Äôm at my wits end. I know something is wrong, but I feel like since my vitals and bloodwork are not at a concerning level, that my doctors are not taking me seriously. ",05-04-2024,1,0,Symptoms

 Most of the posts made it clear that although cleavage is not the norm, short shirts and shoulders out are not unusual anymore despite what alot of outdated advice online says. 
I was on the subway yesterday in full length trousers and a sleeveless top as it is so sunny (not quite spagetti straps, my shoulder were out but no cleavage on show) when an older women (60/70s) walked up to me tapping both my shoulders and shaking her head and wagging her finger at me. I had no idea what she was saying, I smiled politely and turned around but she persisted touching me talking louder and louder.

Was it disrespectful to have my shoulders out or was that just an encounter with an snarky old lady? I still have a few days left so want to avoid any further disrespectful incidents if that was the case. Appriciate any thoughts

AITAH for intending to cut contact with my childhoof friend after she befriended a groomer?,burningspeechman,1,1cjrmsk,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cjrmsk/aitah_for_intending_to_cut_contact_with_my/,0,"So I (20M) and this girl (20F) have been friends since we were in elementary school, so obviously we are pretty close, I used to see her as a sister but recent events made me rethink the situation, let me explain:  
  
This girl (let's call her Noelle), was raised in quite a troublesome house. Her older sister would often bully her, her father is a selfish, sexist scum and her mother never moved a finger to protect her. So when I saw her going to college, getting a job and going out to drink with friends, I was happy for her. Since I am also working and going to college, we don't talk that much, but we're still close and care for each other.  
  
However, in the last few days she did something we never thought she would. She started posting pics with a guy, let's call him Tony (Idk his age but it ranges from 18 to 20, and that will be important for later). They have been going out every day for the last 10 days or so, going to each other's houses since apparently they are neighbors, and even went to the beach together with a mutual friend of ours. Some of you might think I am jealous, but that's really not the case. I'm happy to see her happy and would be happy to see her with a good friend.  
  
But here's the thing: about 3-4 months ago, Tony's ex got exposed on twitter for dating her when she was 15-16 and he was 18-19, manipulating her, and lying her age to everyone that knew them. It was a big scandal, since he was quite famous in the underground rock community of our state, leading some of the most famous artists of the genre to publicaly despise him, some girls also related how he treated them, verbally abusing and trying his schemes on them. After that, Tony deleted all of his social media and has't been seen since, until now.  
  
Unfortunately, his ex deleted all of the screenshots she posted because she filed a report against him and the cops instructed her to do so, making it impossible to find solid evidence of what he did. I didn't read the screenshots either due to my own lazyness, something I regret so fucking much now.  Some of his ex's posts still hint at the situation, and some famous people in the community talk about it, but no solid evidence against him exists on the internet as far as I know.  
  
Besides that, the guy is a fucking jerk. Still talking about his ex, he stole one of her bras and posted in a group chat, alongside the message: ""did any of yall girls who slept here forgot something?"".   
Besides that, he once asked a friend to borrow his house to throw a party and absolutely THRASHED the house. Beer cans everywhere, cigarette burns on furniture, and not a single dime paid to clean.  
That alone would make me avoid him and any of his friends, the crime in question only makes it worse.  
  
The thing is: Noelle KNOWS all of that because, according to her, the guy ""forced himself to tell her"", but claimed things were blown out of proportion, and he commited himself to a psychiatric clinic and is better now. Although I am no specialist, I'm quite sure you can't heal ""douchebagness"" in only 3 months. It seems to me that she is either being manipulated by him or simply does not care about the things he did because he is cool and makes her feel well.

By the way, Noelle has a boyfriend, Levi (idk his age) who is ALSO well-known in the underground rock community. Levi once was accused of abuse, which is something I only found out after this whole situation. Since Noelle believes Levi is inocent and thinks the claims were exaggerated, this definitely does not apply to Tony, since it's not just a claim, there is actual evidence of what he did.

&#x200B;

What baffles me about this is that Levi definitely knows about this guy and what he did, and still his girlfriend is hanging out with Tony every single day, I have no idea of what is going on with these two.

  
Surprisingly enough, one of our friends (Anna, 21F) contacted me while I was writing this. She told me that Noelle wanted to talk to me since I posted something on my twitter account that made her sad. Me and my girlfriend have been posting some things about how you can't trust people and etc. My GF went a bit further, posting about how ""some ppl be hanging out with abusers and think that it's hot shit"".   
Noelle told Anna about how it hurts to see all of her friends turning their backs on her and claiming she supports this kind of behavior, and ngl it made me feel quite guilty, but at the same time she's a grown woman and should know how to spot a liar or at least understand the gravity of the situation.    
Now I see she is being manipulated, and Anna said Noelle wants to talk to me. I told Anna that Noelle is more than welcome to do so, and I plan to contact her myself to discuss, but if I can't convince her she is being manipulated by this jerk, there is no point in standing arround to watch them shit and giggle until said shit hits the fan.

By that logic a DC voltage (0 Hz) would be the same as an open circuit. If we look at a simple series RC circuit in the time domain then there is some current passing through (for a very small amount of time) I know why this happens intuitively and mathematically. However what confused me was since we know by a fourier transform the capacitor is basically an open circuit that means there shouldn't be any current flow. I'm pretty sure the explanation is when the voltage source is switched on then for an instant its not a perfect DC source so it has the transient response.

Laid off from job at the same time that I have a restraining order against another employee,happypinwheel,1,1cjrmq0,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1cjrmq0/laid_off_from_job_at_the_same_time_that_i_have_a/,0,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôll start by saying that I am currently waiting to hear back from several lawyers that I have called, but it‚Äôs Friday evening, so I don‚Äôt expect to hear back until Monday.

I am a subcontractor at the site I work at. The ‚Äúprime‚Äù on the contract owns the building, and virtually all of my colleagues are employees of the prime. The prime is a multi-billion dollar company, and my company only has 400 people nationwide. I am the only subcontractor from my company at this specific site.

I went on a few dates with a coworker who works for the prime. Essentially, things took a turn, and I called the police on him. He was charged with domestic violence, harassment, and trespassing. This meant that a restraining order was automatically put in place.

His attorney submitted a request to modify the restraining order to allow ‚Äúincidental contact,‚Äù which would allow him to pass me in the hallway without going back to jail. He is only allowed to talk to me about work related matters, but he is now allowed to be in the same building again.

This week, on the SAME day that we found out he would be allowed to come back to work, my company told me that my current role is no longer funded past May 31. They said that the prime on the contract had budget cuts, which affects my role. They are telling me that they can transfer me to a different role on a different program across the country, but I have to let them know if I‚Äôm open to a transfer by Monday (5 days notice to make a decision and 30 days notice that I can‚Äôt continue in my current role). They also told me that other employees from my company on the same program are affected at other locations; yet, when I called someone that should have been affected (or at least should know about cuts), he was not aware of this.

I have received NOTHING in writing about my role not being funded anymore. I have sent them an email asking for more information about the cuts. I think it is very suspicious that (1) there is such a quick turnaround on things and (2) this is happening on the same day that the restraining order is modified. I am personally wondering if the legal team on either my company‚Äôs side or the prime‚Äôs is concerned about liability - if he talks to me about anything that is not work related, he can be arrested again. I imagine that that‚Äôs a really big liability/concern for both companies, and they were probably more comfortable with things when he wasn‚Äôt allowed to come to work at all. Now, they have to deal with a situation where he can come to work but cannot talk to me, even though he is on the SAME TEAM as me.

Additionally, subcontractors are always the first to go in the event of budget cuts, so I suspect that I am a million times easier to get rid of than he is. When my company told me the news over a phone call, they actually told me that they had a ‚Äúlong-term solution to the circumstances,‚Äù (the transfer to a new location) so I am speculating that I am losing my job not due to budget cuts, but due to the fact that I called the police.

I am extremely suspicious, but I don‚Äôt know where to start on potentially investigating this. I did ask for more information about the cuts in writing, which I think will be an important step in determining if this is really budget-related or not. Beyond that and applying for new jobs, I am not sure what else I should be doing right now.

I would really appreciate any legal advice that I might be able to get while I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from lawyers. I live in Colorado.",05-04-2024,1,0,

I don‚Äôt understand Door Dash‚Äôs refund policy ,becs32,1,1cjrmpu,doordash,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1cjrmpu/i_dont_understand_door_dashs_refund_policy/,1,"I am baffled by the lack of customer support from door dash and looking to get understanding. I just had a $275 order and the following happened:

1. A whole meal was left on the street
2. The dasher left a ripped bag with open curry that then got into the containers of all the other food in the bag, making it inedible
3. Curry was seeping through the bag and on the front porch

I have photos of all of this and even the photo from the dasher shows the food coming out of the bag. On a $275 order, DD only gave me a $50 refund.

To make matters worse, this is our first night home from Children‚Äôs Hospital where our three year old has been for the last 7 days. Our community generously gave us a $200 gift card and we ordered food on the way home from the hospital. It feels like such a waste of a gift that we needed. It‚Äôs deflating and I don‚Äôt understand how they handle this. It‚Äôs been terrible working with door dash.

Now this Monday, I called her and she didn't have time and asked me to stay until Tuesday so we can hangout. I had a problem where I had to leave on Monday. On Tuesday I receive a message from her saying ""Are you enjoying your town?"" which I found odd and said ""yes, a lot"" and sent her a video of me outside in the wild. 

She started to ghost me and didn't reply to my messages. I asked her today to hang and after few hours she replied ""I won't hang out because you're a liar  and I saw you on Tuesday even though you said you'll leave"". I left on Monday and came back today. I found it odd and asked where she saw me and said she saw me and my car downtown on Tuesday. I showed her my car's info where it says the previous locations and my car didn't run since Monday evening. She didn't apologize for her reaction at all and I said why would I lie to hang when I try to make contact every time. She didn't reply me yet and said she'll get back to me later...

He grew up rural and has experience raising meat and egg chickens, and I‚Äôve learned a TON over the past ~3 years (lots of research and hands on experience), so although our oldest ladies are only two, it‚Äôs driving me insane that I can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong with our girl, Mackenzie.

Important info: on 01MAY2024 when checking the cameras to make sure everyone was roosted, we noticed her on the floor of the coop. We placed her back up on the roost, and she promptly went back down. We figured ‚Äúokay, maybe just a late egg for her,‚Äù and went to bed. The following morning she was still on the ground.
She is not egg bound - we did Epsom salt baths and performed the cloaca goosing. She looks like she‚Äôs trying to lay, but no egg (see dookie pics). No evidence of resp infection aside from labored breathing. She is drinking water and can stand, though prefers not to (she will move to reposition and throughout the night). I‚Äôve been giving her nutridrench and rubbing warmed vetrx on her waddle/head bitties. She ate a decent amount of scrambled egg today too with enthusiasm and is attentive/still #1 StankEyeMasterQueen.

I think my mom hates me,No_Strength9952,1,1cjrmmw,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1cjrmmw/i_think_my_mom_hates_me/,0,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start because it feels like this has been my whole life. My mom has become a person that would be unrecognizable to who she was five years ago. I feel insane saying that, but she was once such a wonderful person who put so much love into our home. Today I was just screamed at because she was mad and I just got off work and didn‚Äôt make dinner right away. I am 21, I‚Äôm her oldest daughter who‚Äôs in college and starting my seasonal job which is labor intensive and I‚Äôm coming home tired and a little worn out. I make the dinners around 4-5 days of the week, and usually leave to my boyfriend‚Äôs house (it‚Äôs the only way to escape) for maybe a day total but I sleep over. My mom is breeding dogs, she put a lot of effort into this and currently we have 8 dogs, and it‚Äôs a lot of work that I honestly didn‚Äôt sign up for. I love them all yes, but it‚Äôs so exhausting to constantly be taking care of them, being a student, and working all at the same time in one week (especially during the fall). If I can‚Äôt keep up, I get a lecture about how I‚Äôm not responsible and I need to pick up the slack. On top of this, I run a small business on the side breeding fish, it‚Äôs a passion and I‚Äôm really trying to manage everything. My mom threatened to sell my dog (who‚Äôs in my name now) because she was to much work, and I‚Äôm begging her not to, and she constantly uses this to get me to do things for her. I stay up late and take her for walks early in the morning, because that was one of the requirements so she can stay. I told her I was thinking about moving out and I could tell she was upset, and said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand the reality of moving out‚Äù and I get that, but Im moving out with a friend and trying to get more jobs during the winter as well. I feel like I do so much, and I get punished if I don‚Äôt do it how, when and where she wants it. I find myself questioning reality of if I‚Äôm making up scenarios in my head or if it actually happened. Everything she does and gets mad at me for is something she does actively (Leaving laundry in the dryer, leaving cups around the kitchen). Today I felt was just a point where I need help, I want to know if I‚Äôm overreacting or if this is serious. She often does display irrational responses during arguments, and gets regularly called out by my stepdad (he‚Äôs not much better). She was mad the moment she walked in, I was immediately upset because I know what follows. She got mad at me for the kitchen (from yesterday) wasn‚Äôt clean even tho I just got home and was taking care of my responsibilities before moving on to general ones. I‚Äôm tired already, and sent a text to  my step dad asking if he can make dinner tonight. She gives me a silent treatment, which I get if you need to be quiet I go upstairs upset, and my stepdad not 20 minutes later comes in and starts accusing me of doing nothing since I got home, and angrily informed him that no, I did my responsibilities and let the dogs outside before my mom got home. So now I know she told him a different story, so I‚Äôm already put off and just irritated. I while goes by and I‚Äôm taking care of my fish when I hear my sister come home and yelling starts and I hear her crying, so I open my door quietly to hear what‚Äôs happening and I just hear my mom say ‚Äúyou are just as irresponsible and lazy as your sister‚Äù. I was taken back, and I was so tired at this point I just start silently crying, but my mom hears me and gets mad and sends her husband to come and investigate. I run to the bathroom and lock the door and I‚Äôm still here until she goes to bed. I know this post is a mess but idk what to do and now I‚Äôm at the point of asking strangers to help me find a solution. I am scared but idk if it‚Äôs me being scared of an argument or something dangerous, and I just want me and my dog to live freely. I don‚Äôt want to loose her, and I‚Äôm scared I will because she uses her against me (I think) to get what she wants and idk how much time I have left before this all blows up .

I do want honesty, I have a therapist but she‚Äôs connected to my mom, and feel like I can‚Äôt be completely honest with her. I just want to know if I‚Äôm insane or not, and if I‚Äôm the problem I will  return to therapy and work out my issues so resolve this best I can.",05-04-2024,1,0,

i have this one friend who just gives me the *vibe* of a queer person. i joke with him that he‚Äôs a femboy bc of how *vibe-y* he is. he swears that he‚Äôs straight/cis but last year i remember him complaining about how he can‚Äôt be a woman (now he swears he never said that). he said he‚Äôd wear thigh high socks and has a blahaj ‚Äúfor the memes‚Äù. Today i got him to try on one of my old crop tops and his behavior seemed very un-cis. he thought that because he was wearing a crop top he was automatically a woman (and acted so).

(my opinion is that if you‚Äôre so insecure in your gender identity you think putting on a crop top automatically makes you a woman, you were already a woman to begin with, but that‚Äôs just me)

i have a feeling that he‚Äôs not cis and can‚Äôt realize it/come out because his parents are slightly LGBTQ-phobic (i sent him femboy outfit inspiration and his dad saw his search history and gave him a lecture, he told me that he ‚Äúalmost cried‚Äù). he also finds gender identities very hard to process (his brain short circuits when i explain it)

i told him my theories abt him being not-cis and made sure he wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable with/felt disrespected by my theory.

"If the US invested into mental health care and resources, we wouldn‚Äôt have near as much theft or crime in general ",p03-,1,1cjrmks,Asmongold,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1cjrmks/if_the_us_invested_into_mental_health_care_and/,0,"Investing in mental health care and resources could lead to a reduction in theft and crime due to several factors:

1. **Addressing Root Causes:** Many crimes, including theft, are committed by individuals struggling with mental health issues such as impulse control disorders or substance abuse. By providing access to mental health services, these underlying issues can be addressed, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.

2. **Early Intervention:** Investing in mental health care can facilitate early intervention and treatment for individuals at risk of engaging in criminal behavior due to mental health issues. This can prevent the escalation of problems and mitigate the likelihood of criminal activity.

3. **Reducing Recidivism:** Treating mental health issues in incarcerated individuals can reduce the likelihood of reoffending upon release. Without proper mental health support, individuals may return to criminal behavior due to untreated underlying issues.

4. **Community Well-being:** Improved mental health resources can contribute to overall community well-being, fostering a sense of connection and support among residents. Stronger communities are less likely to experience high rates of crime, including theft.

5. **Alternative Solutions:** Investing in mental health care can provide alternative solutions for individuals who might otherwise turn to crime due to lack of access to appropriate support systems. This can include employment assistance, housing support, and rehabilitation programs tailored to mental health needs.",05-04-2024,1,0,Discussion

I‚Äôm really struggling with my mom‚Äôs recent obsession with superstitions, particularly belief in ‚Äúdisti‚Äù or ‚Äúnazar‚Äù. It‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs affecting our daily lives and causing a lot of unnecessary stress.

She has started imposing strict rules on when we can go out, burning papers to get rid of ‚Äúnazar‚Äù multiple times a day, and even avoiding interactions with people like electricians or plumbers because she thinks they bring negativity into the house. She also sprinkles turmeric water everywhere and insists my dad wash his legs before she‚Äôll greet him.

I‚Äôve tried reasoning with her, suggesting that these beliefs are likely just in her mind, but she insists her symptoms like nausea or stomach aches are due to weak stars and her childhood experiences in graveyards. This has only intensified in the past couple of years.

I‚Äôm at a loss for how to help her see reason, especially since I only come home once a year and want to spend time with friends without her worrying excessively. Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated. I hate seeing my mom consumed by these superstitions.",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice Wanted

Just had a very very weird incident with my family‚Äôs Goldendoodle Oliver (5yo Male). My sister had yelled at me and my mom shouting that Oliver was shaking and wouldn‚Äôt move and was acting extremely weird. We come upstairs straight away to find him standing frozen in a spot, tail fully behind his legs, and shaking to death violently and like never before. This dog is usually filled with life and is always joyful and happy so to see him like this was very concerning. According to my sister, he was just laying on the floor like usual and randomly jumped up and was shaking violently and tail behind his legs. We have never seen this kind of behavior from him before. He doesn‚Äôt have any kind of anxiety or ptsd and is usually a chill bouncy dog. I suggested maybe he had a bad dream that had him acting like this but usually when he has bad dreams, all he does is slightly whimper and twitch his paws a bit as if he‚Äôs running, not fully stand up violently shaking and refuse to move. It took about 10 minutes of petting him and soothing him to bring him down, then he instantly perked up and started acting like his playful puppy self again. We are very concerned and worried because he‚Äôs never exhibited behavior like this before. If anybody can recommend something or even try to explain it that would be great!

Small affordable synth for singer-songwriter performing?,milestfbaxxter,1,1cjrmji,synthesizers,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/1cjrmji/small_affordable_synth_for_singersongwriter/,0,"I'm a singer-songwriter, looking for a decent, small-ish, affordable synth I can get for performing and songwriting. That basically means playing chords with my left hand, and some simple melodic stuff with my right.

It should have around 37 keys; I find that 32 keys is often too few, and more than 37 quickly gets too big for something to have on your lap or on a regular desk. But it's flexible.

It must have at least four note polyphony; I must be able to both play a basic chord while playing a simple melody.

I'd say the maximum price is 400 EUR, but getting closer to a Korg Volca in price would be great.

Earlier I got the Roland J-6 Chord, but it wasn't quite what I'd hoped. One big negative is that you can't have a chord sequence playing while also playing a melody on the keys/pads. You also can't have any custom chord banks, so being able to play all the chords you might need to perform a certain piece live could be impossible. (It also doesn't have many keys/pads, but I felt being able to play a chord with a single key could help make it workable.)

I have considered maybe getting an Arturia Keystep 37 and connecting it to the J-6, as that might make it into a fully workable option, giving more keys while (presumably) allowing me to manually play the chords I need while also playing a melody. But it is a bit more cumbersome than just having one unit (gets difficult placing on your lap), and I'm worried it might still not work how I'd like (like still not being able to play a chord + melody, for whatever reason).

I knew about his PA like 4 months after we started dating. He told me he was better then i kept consistently finding stuff and after almost two years together he ""cheated"" it was just messages with another girl he used to know but he saved her photos and met up with her at a park without my knowledge. There was no sex involved it was really just emotional cheating and hiding stuff, in hindsight it was his PA complete taking over him and him needing diff material to work with (not an excuse, but an explanation in my mind). 

Since that he has given me passwords and access to anything I ask for and has been completely open, he did relapse with porn last fall and that's when he finally decided to get help and do meetings. Since the meetings started I can see the change in every aspect of his life. He's genuinely a much better person and he's able to elaborately communicate his emotions and be truthful with me. 

We've both had many mental health struggles and we are young and figuring life out, but since he started his recovery he's become the person I originally fell in love with. What he did to me was terrible I forgive him but will never forget. I feel like after everything we've become stronger and closer. The problem is I still have many trust issues. I came into our relationship with several anxiety, depression and ocd. I struggle with it everyday and I do have help but it only does so much. 

His words have aligned with his actions and he hasn't done anything since the meetings started last fall that really seemed suspicious. He says he hasn't watched since last fall and I believe just because of how much change i've seen. I feel like i'm the issue now cause i can't stop compusivly checking and monitoring his entire online presence. It's an everyday thing and i'll check when i wake up and check when i go to bed. a lot of it is out of fear i'll get hurt again, why do i still feel this way if he's been so good to me since he's been actively in recovery. 

Please if anyone is in a similar situation with the compulsive checking stuff or fear , let me know what helps you!

To give some background I‚Äôm 27. I have 6 years in the military, I got out early 2022. I‚Äôve been working in sales since then, starting out in a b2b role for a year and working my way up to a role at a company that handles a lot of commercial and defense industry applications. The pay is okay for the role but nothing special. 

Here is my question: Recently a federal job opened up to me, making a little over $100k as a moderate estimate but on the more aggressive side it would be closer to $200k. This role is a three and a half year gig w potential to make it a career and requires that I move. It would require a lot of OT, think 60-80 hour weeks, a couple days off a month. Personally, I have worked similar schedules in the military and this doesn‚Äôt bother me, I know I can handle it. This role is in a HCOL area. I‚Äôd also like to note that this opportunity excites me a lot more than what I‚Äôm currently doing. 

There‚Äôs no family to worry about but I am in a serious relationship with a potential marriage on the horizon. I know that nothing is going to happen without getting my girlfriend on board, as I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice the relationship for this role. We‚Äôre not too worried about her finding work as she‚Äôs graduated from a very good university and has a solid work history with some high profile companies.

Relationship aside, my thoughts are that, while this role is a complete industry change and the hours are extreme, it would provide valuable and unique experience that is highly marketable, if I decided to pursue a different avenue afterwards, instead of making it a career. I‚Äôd be able to save a decent amount of money, because when will I have a chance to spend it anyways. The savings could be used to jumpstart a business or invest, there‚Äôs no way I could save even remotely the same amount if I stay in my current role. If I chose to make it a career I‚Äôd be looking at higher earning potential over time as well as pretty good benefits and retirement. 

Other considerations though are that while this role I‚Äôm in now doesn‚Äôt make a lot currently, it has a lot of potential for career growth/lateral movement as I develop and there are plenty of doors that should open for me down the line to put me in a spot to invest/branch off on my own in my own businesses, I‚Äôd just have to wait a little longer. 

So my question is, what would you do in a similar situation? Take the money and long hours knowing that you‚Äôll be saving most of it as a foundation to launch off of later or stick it out in the current role? To me there isn‚Äôt really a wrong answer, I‚Äôm just looking for general insight here. Thanks in advance for any answers! ",05-04-2024,1,0,Advice
Is there a term for this?,LouvreLove123,1,1cjrmgu,fashionhistory,https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionhistory/comments/1cjrmgu/is_there_a_term_for_this/,0,"(tl;dr at the end)

I'm not sure if there is a term that already exists that can be applied to this phenomenon. It's where modern people ascribe greater difficulty, pain, inefficiency, or hardship to something from the past than it actually possessed, as a means of declaring themselves superior to said past, or of reassuring themselves that progress has been made, society is moving in the ""right"" direction, ""at least we have it better than before,"" etc.

I want to call it something like ""modernity bias,"" where, for example, we have come to view corsets as ""restrictive"" and ""oppressive"" rather than say, a thing you wore to support your back and keep your boobs in place, that fit you and wasn't laced too tightly. Basically, a bra before there were bras, and in some instances maybe something that was superior to a bra. That's just one example this community is likely to have encountered. We've replaced the reality of wearing stays with fetishized, politicized, extreme examples. Stays as well-fitting garment worn comfortably by most women becomes instead a bizarre figure-altering torture device, and a fetish object, inaccurately worn by Bridgerton actresses who semi-brag about being damaged by a badly designed costume.

Or, like, when we assume that people didn't clean their teeth prior to the invention of the modern plastic toothbrush and toothpaste in a tube. 

Or when historical movies will just put mud on the faces of all the extras, or just make things dirty in general‚Äîyou know, because the past was ""dirty."" 

Or when we forget that fabrics used to breathe a lot better, and that linen from 1720 did not retain body odor in the way that a polyester shirt does today. 

It's like we have to declare that everything *must* have been significantly worse before. 

Like when we forget all the ways that people had of communicating, of getting things done. That a newspaper had multiple editions throughout the day. That urban people in the 19th century had the ability to send letters back and forth during a single day via messengers in the way we might coordinate by email now. 

Another example from many of our lifetimes is how cell phones wiped out pay phones. While a cell may be more convenient than having to use pay phones, I think people born after they disappeared don't truly understand how ubiquitous pay phones truly were. You see this in writing advice forums, where some young people really don't seem to grasp how things worked, and this is stuff that is just from the youths of people who are still in the prime of life! There were payphones *everywhere*. 

So while there are clearly a million examples of this, I'm curious if there is already an existing term. The context I'm specifically looking for is where we **use misconceptions of the past to sort of make ourselves feel better about the present.** It can even be rather nefarious, because by exaggerating the hardships of the past, we sort of tell people to ignore the hardships of the present to a degree, because ""at least it's better."" Sometimes the new ways of doing things are actually worse, or have a net negative impact. 

There's a trade off‚Äîwith phones, for example, you don't have to look for a pay phone, and people can reach you wherever you are, you can talk to your friend who isn't there while you take a walk, but now you have the added anxiety of being constantly reachable. A device in your pocket tracks you, advertises to you, keeps you tethered to work, can serve as a bully with cyber harassment, is addictive, etc. etc. Having lived in worlds with cell phones and with no cell phones, I'm not actually sure that it's really ""better"" with cell phones, it's just different. Maybe it *is* better with them, but we quickly forget what it was really like without them, and exaggerate some of the hardships. 

We quickly forget the world as it truly functioned, as if we are required to *only*  view societal and technological change through the lens of a unidirectional progress towards betterment. And I think there's a bias at work, which can be insidious, and mask the difficulties of the present. I just wondered if there is an existing term for that bias. 

Anyway curious what people think. 

tl;dr‚Äîwhen we assume that something in the past was worse, grosser, more painful, or more inconvenient than it really was, as a way of reassuring ourselves about the social, societal, or technological superiority present, what is that called?

I got accepted to both as a transfer student for civil engineering and I legitimately cannot decide which school I want to go to. Both schools gave me the same amount of aid. UCLA is about a 30 minute drive for me (40m-1h with traffic) while berkeley is about 6-7 hours. I feel like I'd find UCLA to be a much safer option, as I am much closer to my family and home, I'll have more friends going to la (although I know people going to Berkeley too), my girlfriend is transferring to UCLA aswell which is a big factor for me. But at the same time, Berkeley is ranked #1 for civil engineering in the country, and is known and renowned for being the best engineering school. transfers also get a priority for first year housing so for my first year I would likely get approved for. housing. I legitimately cant make a decision and time is running out. My gut is somewhat telling me to go to Berkeley due to the academic superiority but I also feel like I'll severely regret any decision that I make.

Religion and Science,joe_smith_19,1,1cjrmev,religionandscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/religionandscience/comments/1cjrmev/religion_and_science/,0,"Religion and science, at first glance, seem like two separate entities with little in common. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that they have intertwined aspects which are crucial for the betterment of society as a whole. In this context, proving their need for each other can be done by examining several factors such as history, ethics, and personal growth.

1. Historical Relationship: Throughout history, religion has played an essential role in driving scientific advancements. For instance, the medieval period saw significant developments in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine due to the patronage of religious institutions like monasteries. The Church's support for education led to the establishment of universities where scholars could study and teach various subjects, including science.
2. Ethical Guidance: Science is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and ill. It has brought about incredible advancements in medicine, technology, agriculture, etc., but it also raises ethical questions concerning its use and application. For instance, the development of genetic engineering and cloning technologies have raised concerns over their moral implications. Religion provides an essential framework to help society navigate these complex issues by offering a set of values and principles that can guide scientific research and technological advancements.
3. Personal Growth: Both religion and science contribute significantly to personal growth, as they provide different but complementary ways for people to understand the world around them. Religion offers spiritual guidance, helping individuals find meaning in their lives through a connection with something greater than themselves. Science provides an objective understanding of natural phenomena by using empirical evidence to test hypotheses and theories. By combining these two perspectives, humans can develop a more holistic view of reality that enriches personal growth and fosters well-rounded individuals.

In conclusion, religion and science have historically relied on each other for support in various ways. They also provide complementary ethical guidance to help society navigate complex issues and contribute significantly to the personal development of their adherents. By recognizing this interdependence, we can appreciate how these two seemingly disparate fields work together to create a more enriched human experience.",05-04-2024,1,0,

On the left we have misinformation, confusion, pain and suffering, name calling, unprofessional inexperienced leadership. On the right we have a track record of greatness, hope and prosperity, freedom, common sense, good governance, and a government working for you. 

  
Each and every by election will be a great fight to the end, and as Members of our party it is important to highlight the important aspects of our election. First lets take a look at the NDP, Canada's opposition. 

  
The NDP is led by Trickbar who has had a steep decline in activity, and even a plan. After endorsing socialism and communism during the General Election with Karl Marx the NDP painted a pretty faint picture for Canadians proving the NDP did not care for the future of our country. Now, the NDP is not a one man party, it has a sidekick. SaskPoliticker is a failed Prime Minister who added reckless spending to Canada's debt by voting in favor of direct democracy, which increased taxes on Canadians. Furthermore Sask flipped to three different parties as Prime Minister before resigning and calling a $600 million dollar election. I don't know about you but changing party stripes while Prime Minister is not a good look! Sask lost his re election bid in the Prairies. 

  
Now, in **Southern Ontario** we have SaskPoliticker vs Nick. An NDP vs Conservative race, Sask has changed some of his positions since his last election, including who he supports and which names appear on the NDP platform (Karl isnt on there now) but Sask still has shown his plans for Canadians on crime, carbon hypocrisy, drug overdoses, foreign affairs, and stable governance are all in question. Sask has not spoken about what his parties policy is on crime, which is at an all time high right now. Furthermore Sask has not spoke about his official carbon tax position which adds to inflation. Sask hasn't spoke against ""safe supply"" nor has he talked about his policy when it comes to foreign affairs. I would argue a lot of this policy the NDP does not really care about. As for the NDP and their financial policy it leaves a lot of murky water, SaskPoliticker has proposed multiple scenarios if elected and nothing stays consistent! Who will Canadians get? Socialist Sask, or capitalist sask? I would urge voters to look at Sask's track record of lying and manipulating voters minds in his personal beneficial interest. 

  
Nick is a Conservative who supports lowering crime, stable governance, and working on serving a full term to benefit Canadians in Southern Ontario. As an MP Nick will play apart in the government by voting debating, being active, and promoting policy in favor of Southern Ontarians. A Conservative government with Nick on board will be beneficial to Canadians as Canada will add another highly trusted MP to the list of many within the Conservative Party. 



As we move onto the **Golden Horseshoe** it is important to note we have an NDP party endorsing a former Prime Minister here. With regards to the NDP endorsing this member it shows clear that the NDP and this independent member have some common interest when it comes to governing. While the NDP spends time rambling on about how irrelevant and inconsistent they are I truly do not know what the message is here with Model-Wanuke. Wanuke has not mentioned much about personal policy nor has made many visits inside of the Province to allow voters to develop an understanding of the situation. 

  
Which is why Conservatives are offering an alternative, we are offering former Conservative leader [ModelPeterMackay](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModelPeterMackay/) who will fight to lower taxes, balance the budget, remove the carbon tax and bring down crime. Under an elected Conservative member you can send a message to the woke NDP and inactive Independent by saying yes to building a better future for all Canadians. 

  
And finally, we have the **Territories** which is the former riding of failed liar Infamous Whole. TheTrashMan, the NDP candidate is an out of touch radical who continues to support the uprooting of Canadians. Nobody in parliament even knows who TheTrashMan is, he is inactive, irresponsible, and is walking into supporting a Karl Marx style socialist regime in which has no plan! In fact the NDP is such a fringe party with no plan it will be impossible for Canada to move forward if an NDP is elected here. We must move forward, not backwards. 

  
Which is why Melp is the best choice for Canada in the Territories. Melp will fight for lower taxes, a balanced budget, safe streets, no safe supply, and stable governance. Under our Conservative majority Canadians are satisfied with results and transparency. Our party will continue this record and adding Melp to the team will send a message to the NDP to go to the center, not veer to the far radical left! ",05-04-2024,1,0,üì∞ Press Release

>\*\*What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?\*\*

As in title, but willing to push closer to 1200-1300 USD if need be, I'm very new to PC builds so I might be a bit optimistic with the original budget.

1. >\*\*When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.\*\*

1. >\*\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\)\*\*  

Only need the actual PC components, already have a 120hz monitor for my Xbox Series X as well as keyboard and mouse, my understanding is that I'll need a CPU, GPU, RAM, PC case, Motherboard, CPU cooler, SSD. (If I'm forgetting anything blatantly obvious I'm sorry).

1. >\*\*Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?\*\*  

Australia in New South Wales (NSW), but can order any parts from anywhere within Australia.

1. >\*\*If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.\*\*>

Mentioned before I have a monitor, as well as a keyboard and mouse. (Dell Ultrasharp U2724D, Razer Ornata V3, and Razer Cobra respectively)

1. \*\*Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?\*\*¬†

Not often, if ever, certainly not right away, far too inexperienced to mess with components in that manner.

1. >\*\*Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)\*\* 

Not really, unless there is some special component/feature hidden within the needs listed earlier, I'm not worried. 

1. >\*\*Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?\*\* 

Not too stressed about this either, I've found water coolers to be pretty nice so if I can fit one in the budget that'd be nice but absolutely not essential

1. >\*\*Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?\*\* 

I've been led to believe I can download Windows onto a USB drive for free?? If not, then yes I will, preferably Windows 11.

She's gone. No matter how much you wish she'd come back, how much you think you'll fix it and somehow be back together, it won't happen. You may still love her, but she's already moved on if she's the one who broke up with you.

Step 2: Cope.
Find a coping mechanism that is HEALTHY. Like a show or listening to music. It will make you happy now that the light that once Illuminated your life has been burned out and is Illuminating another somewhere else

Step 3: Get back on the horse. 
Find someone new. No not as a rebound, you loved your last partner and can't move on just yet. Find a friend or a confidant, and just be their friend. If feelings manifest, do NOT capitalize. They will not want you. That is a fact. 

Step 4: FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT STEP: Reboot.
Find a new significant other. This is your bounce back, this is your rebound. Only reach step 4 when complete with step 3. Your rebound can be the friend you made, if you feel confident that they feel the same way you do, which is probably not the case. DO NOT LOOK FOR YOUR EX IN YOUR NEW PARTNER. I REPEAT. DO NOT LOOK FOR YOUR EX IN YOUR NEW PARTNER. It will end the same way and you will be back at Step 1.

This is all just information on the beginner tier. Not specifically, but helpful hints that are unlocking characters from Barbarian to El Tigre.. and absolutely please include more info after that, all info is welcome. 

What I‚Äôve heard from searching sites :

- Witch is A- / B+ tier 
- Greg is a top character (for beginners) 
- only spend your coins on chest tickets


What I‚Äôve used and felt comfortable with:

- Bo is a favorite (especially to start with)
- Witch is rarely an option in chests till you acquire 30+ coins, so is it worth levelling her up?
- Greg is nice to get coins/gems from trees so you can increase your group faster but is he worth more than that? 
- I got archer queen from CoC bonus, she has become a first choice over most but still only above average. 
- players I don‚Äôt pick are ‚Äúdynamike, medic, chicken and hog rider‚Äù 
- don‚Äôt spend your money on the specials/spells. Stupidly bought cannon, waste of coins


Questions:

- what do you spend your coins on? Save them for later in the game? Spend on characters in shop? Only buy chest tickets?
- what above is wrong?
- what characters should you focus on to evolve? Which ones become your go-to choices to use as you level up?

The last 5 MD4N's I've done I've gotten Lunar Memory each time on Floor 5, bar one run (so 4/5 runs I get Lunar Memory). The main requisite is to have the two Starter Buffs unlocked that give you +1 EGO Gift per shop, for a total of 5 EGO Gifts per shop but it doesn't hurt to have Starlight upgrades which help you gain Cost.

You just:

* Buy every EGO Gift in every store (may need to forego upgrades for this)

* Hit every event and every combat that give an EGO reward (the ones with the thick yellow outline)

* Always take the end of combat reward to 'Obtain a random T1-2 EGO Gift' (unsure on the actual wording)

If anyone plays HSR it's very similar to the Simulated Uni Ruan Mei cheese, you just end up exhausting most floor's EGO Gift pools to the point where it always gives high tier Gifts. It reaches a point where the 'Obtain a random T1-2 EGO Gift' routinely gives me Faith, Piece of Relationship, Non-Disclosure Agreement (all T4) and the final floor routinely gives me Lunar Memory as a post-fight reward or in the final shop.

I've only tried this on MD4N so can't speak to its worth on MD4H but if anything it will be more consistent there, because they plan to remove Floor 5 from MD4N as far as I've seen.",05-04-2024,1,0,Guide/Tips

Me (24M) and my partner (28f) have been together for almost 5 years now. I've struggled with RJ from the beginning, and in my previous relationship which I blame RJ somewhat for ending among irreconcilable differences. Now, allow me to preface that both of us are Bisexual in nature, in fact she has described herself as mostly a lesbian but with me being the exception. She's been with a couple of other men but they were during a period of particular weakness after the end of a long-term and abusive (verbally, and financially) relationship, which I understand given her previous life circumstances. It still killed me inside daily for 2 years but in the end it didn't really matter because I loved her more than anything, and still do to this day. However, I've never felt bothered by hearing about her relationships with women.

Now this Monday, I called her and she didn't have time and asked me to stay until Tuesday so we can hangout. I had a problem where I had to leave on Monday. On Tuesday I receive a message from her saying ""Are you enjoying your town?"" which I found odd and said ""yes, a lot"" and sent her a video of me outside in the wild. 

She started to ghost me and didn't reply to my messages. I asked her today to hang and after few hours she replied ""I won't hang out because you're a liar  and I saw you on Tuesday even though you said you'll leave"". I left on Monday and came back today. I found it odd and asked where she saw me and said she saw me and my car downtown on Tuesday. I showed her my car's info where it says the previous locations and my car didn't run since Monday evening. She didn't apologize for her reaction at all and I said why would I lie to hang when I try to make contact every time. She didn't reply me yet and said she'll get back to me later...

I'm thinking of not DMing her anymore since she went off for no reason without calling or asking me where I am. How do I go further and do I even try to go out with her?

I rewatched it hyped for season 2. 4th rewatch. I am pretty confident thats where they will lean with this. 

They get the DNA of a very sick people, or maybe, get this, from a sperm of a potential baby. In both cases, when it expires it either meant the person died or the sperm is not viable anymore. Then they look at the numbers and the chip can translate the signal and make their body react to it. if it fears it, it is bad, but you get the benefit of not getting sick. If you see covid numbers on the screen, bam, covid triggers on your mind, but not your body, cause your not actually sick.

For me that explains why they need to leverage the people instead of just running sumulations on computers. mayber they never cracked the real life problem of protein folding and it is easier and cheaper to simulate it on the body.

Problem for me was we stopped at Ngauranga, but the door would not open after several presses of the button, wiht the guard not to be seen. Fellow commuters were not able to offer any advice. So I had to get off at Petone and travel back on the next non-express service, and get off at Ngauranga. I had of course requested that the guard make sure I could get off, so that happened. About 90 minutes later I got on the train again, heading for Wellington Station - train brimming full of 'Canes supporters.

Just watched the finale (and it hit me hard),hicestdraconis,1,1cjrm4d,madmen,https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1cjrm4d/just_watched_the_finale_and_it_hit_me_hard/,0,"So as the final seconds of the finale were rolling by I thought, no this can‚Äôt be it. This sucks. This is lame. Then the coke ad hits and I was like. Man this is not a good ending. Oh well. Great show. 

And then 10 seconds later I burst into tears. 

I can‚Äôt say what exactly it was. But I think it was the honest desperation of it. I wanted some final speech. Some big moment of clean reflection of clarity where it all made sense. But life isn‚Äôt like that. Life doesn‚Äôt give you a moment to make everything right. It just gives you a choice: are you gonna give up, or are you gonna try?

Somehow I managed to make it to the end without spoilers. And in the middle of the last season I stated to get really anxious about getting to the end. Because I felt like it was really clear the dichotomy it was setting but. And I was sure which way it was gonna go. In preparation for watching the show I even told my girlfriend I knew it was gonna end one of two ways. He‚Äôs either gonna himself, or he‚Äôs gonna find self fulfillment.

The real answer was so much harder, and so much more true. It isn‚Äôt a choice to give up or to just ‚Äúbe better‚Äù. It‚Äôs a choice to give up, or to keep going. And the harsh truth is that all we have is what we choose to do.

What a sad and kind and dark and beautiful finale. I cried, I drank whiskey, I cried many times, I went on a run with tears still in my eyes. I‚Äôm surprised just how much this got to me. 

Thank you everyone involved in this show (the writers especially) for an amazing and beautifully honest human experience. What a gift. If we were are what we choose to do, thank you for choosing to make this truly honest piece of art.",05-04-2024,1,0,

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c8u8mi/aitah_for_not_supporting_my_sisters_engagement/)**: April 20, 2024**

I (24 F) am planning my wedding to my partner of almost 6 years. We got engaged at the end of November 2023 and we set our wedding date for September 2024! Before we get into the current situation I want to provide a little context. When we were growing up it was always abundantly clear that my sister (20 F) was the family favorite. She was always given special privileges and talked more highly of than me. For this reason, we didn‚Äôt get along during our childhood and most of our teenage years.

After attending therapy as an adult, I came to understand that I couldn‚Äôt hold my parents treatment towards her against her because she was a child and the only people to blame are my parents. After working through that, her and I became really close. For the past few years we have been inseparable. She‚Äôs my best friend and I am hers. I asked her to be my MOH and she was so excited!

She started dating her current BF (21 M) in late October of 2023. Of course, he just so happens to be everything my family has ever dreamed of in a son-in-law. The exact opposite of my partner. The past 6 months they have been together my sister‚Äôs partner is all my family talks about, even at my bridal appointments. Right after my engagement my sister said that when she found out about my upcoming engagement she made it clear to her BF that this year was about me so she didn‚Äôt want him to bring up anything marriage related until after my wedding. She said she wanted this to be my year.

I‚Äôve dreamed of this wedding my entire life and maybe it‚Äôs selfish to say but I just wanted this one thing to actually be about me.

This leads us to the current situation. Last night my sister (20 F) and her boyfriend of 6 months (21 M) FaceTimed me together and told me that they decided to get married. They said that he would go to ask my parents either today or tomorrow for permission and then he would immediately go buy a ring. They then said that they want me to help plan the official proposal which will happen in 2-3 weeks with the wedding set for November 2024. I told them that I needed time to process and I ended the FaceTime.

An hour later, my sister called me to talk about it and I was sobbing. I explained to her how badly it hurt me that she of all people would do this after she promised that she would let this be my year. I explained to her that I want to be happy for her but I am grieving the loss of my special day because the second our family hears about their engagement it will be as if I and my wedding doesn‚Äôt exist. She cried while I explained myself and then said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it. Just don‚Äôt worry about it. I have to go.‚Äù And hung up the phone. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since. Right now I feel like I have lost my wedding and my best friend. I am the villain in her story for ruining her moment and she is the villain in my story for taking this milestone from me even after she promised she wouldn‚Äôt.

Where do we go from here? AITAH for not just being happy for her?

***Relevant Comments (OOP also posted in TwoHotTakes so some comments are from there):***

Commenter: So they‚Äôre getting engaged and married with in a year? And they‚Äôve only been together a year. Yeah that‚Äôs gonna turn out well. That being said, I‚Äôd be upset as well. Your sister sounds like a jerk. I‚Äôd tell them to go kick rocks.

>**OOP:** They met 6 months ago and they are planning to get married in the month of their 1 year dating anniversary.  
>  
>I have not figured out why things are moving so fast but I hope to get some answers on that soon.

Commenter: What do you mean ""my year""??? I get feeling like you wedding day is ""your day "" but... A YEAR? You will be mad to any family member or friend that will have an important personal event for them in 2024 too? Is your sister allowed to celebrated her birthday in 2024, or does she have to wait until ""your year"" ends? With that being said ESH. your sister is too young to be engaged 6 months into her relationship, your parents are should have been better parents to both of you, and you don't get to demand a WHOLE YEAR for a wedding that statistics say will end up in a divorce.

>**OOP:** One of my bridesmaids is getting married this year and I am also a bridesmaid in her wedding. This is due to our family dynamic. My sister came to me first about making this my year because it is well known that if she has something going on I am the afterthought with our family. My parents were making it about her before she was even engaged. Once they are engaged my wedding will not even be on their radar. That was the meaning behind ‚Äúmy year‚Äù

*How are they going to prepare everything in 6 months? Is she pregnant?*

I was asking the same questions about timeline and booking venues and things but didn‚Äôt get much of an answer.

As of right now, she still has not spoken to me at all.

I guess pregnancy is a possibility but she has not told me that she‚Äôs pregnant so there‚Äôs no way for me to know for sure right now. If she is pregnant, I wish she would‚Äôve come to me and explained that rather than doing what she did.

*Could it be wedding fever from her?*

I can definitely see the wedding fever as a potential cause. I just thought that our relationship was too strong for her to give in to wedding fever at my expense.

We have spoken in the past about how I‚Äôve felt over the years always being second best to her. When we were teenagers she used to laugh and joke about her being the favorite. After therapy, I let my resentment of her for that go and started fresh with her. I guess in the end, some things never change.

*One more thought:*

Thank you for understand where I‚Äôm coming from. My partner and I have talked about this situation and I keep saying that it wouldn‚Äôt bother me in the least if they got engaged as soon as the day after my wedding which is still before their one year dating anniversary. I want her to be happy. But she knows that when it comes to our family the moment she gets engaged my wedding becomes an afterthought. That is why she made that promise to me. She‚Äôs knows that she has always been the first pick (the golden child.) She made this choice knowing how badly it would hurt me. And the sad part is that despite everything I‚Äôve gone through at the hands of my family I could never bring myself to treat her the way she is treating me.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ces6qm/update_aitah_for_not_supporting_my_sisters/)**: April 27, 2024 (1 week later)**

Thank you all for the advice in the comments of my original post! I‚Äôm sorry for taking so long to post an update for you! Btw the sister is NOT pregnant!

I spoke with my sister on Tuesday of this past week and it was not a very positive conversation. I was still extremely hurt and she was angry with me for ruining her excitement. I ended that conversation by telling her that at the end of the day, she would have to make her choice on wether they would go through with this engagement and wedding or wait until after my wedding based on what felt most right to her. She left me on read and I didn‚Äôt reach back out because I felt like the ball was in her court.

Last night she reached out to me and apologized for hurting my feelings. She said that she doesn‚Äôt want things to be bad between us over this. She then started asking me more questions about how I felt. After some more explanation I asked her if she had talked to her boyfriend about our phone call. She said that she did and when I asked how it went she said that he told her she needed to reach out to me and try to make things right. She said it took her awhile to reach out because she was still trying to process her emotions but ultimately she knew he was right.

I asked her what they decided to do and she said that after several days of talking it over they have decided to postpone the proposal until after my wedding in September. She said that their new plan is to get engaged soon after my wedding and plan their wedding for early 2025. They have not said anything to our family about the engagement and my family has been blissfully unaware of the state of my sister and I‚Äôs relationship.

I guess you could say that this is the best case scenario for this situation. There is still quite a bit of tension between my sister and I but hopefully that will get better with time.

***Relevant Comment:***

Commenter: our sister may not be pregnant, but I question the idea of talking proposals and marriage after six months. i would recommend you speak to her about the insanity of that choice, but given the situation as it is, it's probably best not to add any fuel to a still smoldering fire.

>**OOP:** My parents have been encouraging her to do this since they hit the one month mark in their relationship. I whole heartedly believe that my parents are more interested in getting him into the family (he‚Äôs their dream son) rather than looking out for her best interest. Because of this, a couple months ago I sat her down and had a hard conversation.  
>  
>She was upset with me for a couple days but I told her that I could not live with myself if I didn‚Äôt at least give her another perspective on this relationship. She lives with our parents so she is hearing their perspective every day. I explained issues that can come up with someone that you don‚Äôt fully know yet. And I told her that at the end of the day I wanted to protect her from ending up in a situation that I have been in in the past. I tried to explain to her that some things you only learn about a person in time.  
>  
>Right now you‚Äôre in the honeymoon phase of the relationship and that‚Äôs not an accurate representation of what the relationship will be. People are usually on their best behavior at the beginning and then over time as they become more comfortable and the new starts wearing off things can change. I finished the conversation by saying that if he really loves you and has all the best intentions with you he will still be here a year from now. A good man will not walk away from you because you want to date for one year before getting engaged/married.

I have writing samples pinned to my profile (there'll be one down below) and a number of prompts alongside them; I will require writing samples from my partners as well.

>The boar is not dead, though to all the other hunters‚Äô senses it is. It lays motionless on its side within the sled, tied down by rope with two arrows sticking discordantly out of its hide like seams of broken bone. Frozen blood pools in the cracked stomach of the sled, collecting rather than leaking now that red ice has sealed the wood. Poison leaching out of the arrowheads keeps the boar docile, and its breathing so light that only Trapper can see. An ovate in too-thin robes shivers as she ties a garland of rosemary around the beast‚Äôs neck, murmuring prayers to the ancestors that they might find the kill worthy.  
>  
>Winter has seized the land in its vise, its unending waves of cold and snow having transformed the Barony of Marlas into a crueler scape, one Trapper doesn‚Äôt quite recognize. Tranquility abounds along the driven snow, all through the clearing, hiding the buried world and the woes of man but unable to snuff them out. Trapper knows well what a mirage it is, the oppressive winters of his homeland no less savage than the bloodletting summers. The numbing cold does not soothe his aches, for he knows they‚Äôll be worse come morning, come the thaw. Too soon this clearing will melt, its river gone from white to red, the whole Septima Line thrust back to war.  
>  
>Baron Orys refuses to yield to midnight season, to accept its peace, and so from his great warhorse‚Äôs saddle he brazenly belts out a mixture of drunken lyrics and commands, determined to master this hunt even if he does not partake. An entourage on horseback spreads out in his orbit, ranging from eager young footmen to grizzled junkers, all in varying states of inebriation at his command. Their braying is nearly louder than the hounds‚Äô, who hungrily stalk between the sled and the hole they pulled the boar out from. Teased by the hunt but yet unrewarded, they‚Äôre too unruly to be kept in check by the kennel master.  
>  
>On foot slog the unfortunates who actually have to take part in the hunt, Trapper among them. They huddle into their hemp canvas cloaks, glancing up at the moody afternoon sky threatening to crack open with another snowstorm. Dark clouds sweep in low from the south like a riptide, a single vast current swept in from the mountains already menacing the Oldwoods. Its furthest gales reach them as tongues of vengeful cold, flecks of whipped-up snow biting into Trapper‚Äôs exposed skin.  
>  
>By the boar‚Äôs nest leans a typical Mallean, one of Trapper‚Äôs two erstwhile comrades. Sigorn is tall, pale, broad, with the close-set, wide-boned features of a commoner, and a shock of red hair grown out to protect against the elements. Beneath his cloak he proudly bears his blood-flecked armor, each dent a Darkman put into it a point of dear pride. He‚Äôs not the only one, either, the clearing filled with dozens of youths whose first blooding ended in victory amid a blizzard. Baron Orys, deep into his cups after six days of nonstop celebration, saw a break in the storms and gladly called a hunt. When informed he could not go on account of his shattered knee - he simply grinned, and ordered himself tied to his saddle.  
>  
>Trapper remembers the moment his lord fell from the saddle, burned into his nerves. The screaming of horses, skidding hooves catching on the frozen ground. On the edges of his vision a rider smashes into a branch in the din, others don‚Äôt move at all for fear of the blizzard. His spurs dig, his borrowed steed whines, and he races for his lord - only for another to reach him first.  
>  
>‚ÄúWhat a woman.‚Äù Sigorn sighs beside Trapper, craning his neck to look at one of their lord‚Äôs companions of honor. Susannah Oye, junker unlike the others, a pretty, willowy noblewoman well into motherhood, with the lean, ruthless look of a ranger. Her two poisoned arrows are what struck the boar down, and her pride curls off her body like steam. Sigorn‚Äôs face cracks into exaggerated appreciation, and then he turns to their lord‚Äôs other honored companion. Another woman, this one as young as they are, haughtily-built and leering with none of Susannah‚Äôs refinement. Many of those looks are reserved for Trapper, forced to slog on foot as just another hunter. ‚ÄúAnya too. I think she fancies you, eh?‚Äù",05-04-2024,0,0,T4A Wisconsin / Online

The Clash Within,MinionBrained,1,1cjrlu7,ClashOfClans,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1cjrlu7/the_clash_within/,0,"Mark was once a devoted husband, a loving father, and a dedicated employee. But ever since he discovered Clash of Clans, his life took a sharp turn. It started innocently enough. Mark would spend a few hours each day building his clan family, planning cwl hits, and voice chatting with clan members. But as the game consumed more of his time, his relationships began to suffer.

His wife, Sarah, would often find herself alone in bed as Mark stayed up into the early hours of the morning, hunched over his phone or tablet, lost in the world of Clash of Clans. Their once lively conversations turned into one-sided monologues, with Mark only responding with grunts or nods. Their son, Alex, became accustomed to seeing his father's face illuminated by the blue glow of the screen, rather than by his smile. He would plead for his father to play catch or read him a bedtime story, but Mark's only response was a distracted ""later, kiddo.""

As the days passed, Mark became increasingly fixated on the promise of a new update concerning Root Rider Nerf. He eagerly awaited its release, believing it would bring balance to the game and perhaps even restore balance to his life. But as the release date drew nearer, Mark's obsession reached new heights. He became irritable and short-tempered, snapping at his family over the smallest of things. Sarah tried to reason with him, begging him to seek help or at least take a break from the game, but Mark brushed her off, insisting that everything would be fine once the update arrived. Finally, the fateful day arrived. Mark counted down the hours, minutes, and seconds until the update was scheduled to go live.   


As the clock struck midnight, Mark's heart raced with anticipation as he awaited the long-awaited update. But when the notification appeared on his screen, his hopes were shattered like fragile glass.""Bug fixes and minor improvements,"" the message read, mocking him with its brevity.Mark's grip on reality slipped as rage consumed him. Without a second thought, he hurled his phone across the room, the screen cracking upon impact. In a frenzy, he grabbed his laptop and launched Discord, the messaging app where he once found solace among fellow clan members.But instead of finding support, Mark was met with silence. His clanmates had long since grown tired of his neglect and constant complaints about the game. They had muted him, leaving his messages unread and his pleas unanswered.

With a hollow sense of defeat, Mark stumbled out of his house, the weight of his disappointment dragging him down like an anchor. He wandered the empty streets, his mind a whirlwind of despair and regret. Hours passed, and Mark found himself standing on the edge of a bridge, the cold wind biting at his skin. He gazed down at the dark waters below, the allure of oblivion calling out to him like a siren's song.But as he prepared to take that final step, a message flashed across his cracked phone screen. It was from Sarah, his wife, the one person who had always stood by his side through thick and thin.""Please come home,"" the message read, simple yet filled with unspoken emotion.Tears welled up in Mark's eyes as he realized the depth of his folly. He had pushed away the ones who mattered most to him in pursuit of a fleeting fantasy. And now, in his darkest hour, he stood alone on the precipice of his own undoing.With a heavy heart, Mark turned away from the edge and made his way back home. The journey was long and arduous, but with each step, he felt a glimmer of hope flicker within him.When he finally arrived, Sarah was waiting for him with open arms.   


She held him close, her embrace a lifeline in the sea of his despair.But as they stood together in the darkness, a sense of emptiness lingered in the air. Mark knew that his battle was far from over, that the demons of his obsession would continue to haunt him long into the night.And as he glanced down at his cracked phone, its screen illuminated by the soft glow of Discord notifications, he realized that the true clash lay not within the confines of a virtual battlefield, but within the depths of his own troubled soul‚Ä¶",05-04-2024,1,0,Humor & Memes

Sudden itchiness !,executedflash,1,1cjrlu5,DiagnoseMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1cjrlu5/sudden_itchiness/,0,"Hello all, I come to you with a question i seem to be stumped at

  
About maybe 3 weeks ago, i had a quick shower, went to lay in bed, and shortly after this, i began being itchy all over my body, (I did not use any body wash) and i noticed it was everywhere, armpits, legs, back, etc



I woke up fine, nothing abnormal, a few days later, the itching continued, all over, burning armpits, no rashes, itchy back, itchy neck, legs, etc

  
It got so bad i went to pick up some anti histamines and i took 2, it seems to help, its been fine, nothing happened. Of course been showering in the mean time, laundry, etc and being fine!

  
And as of today, its come back again! As of around 5pm today, i went on an evening walk, and started noticing it again- burning itchy armpits, legs super itchy, no rashes, no marks, nothing, back started getting itchy, face getting itchy, head etc (I was fine before i went outside)



Come home, took some anti histamines, again its sloooowly helping, but not drastically.

  
Its definitely becoming hard to deal with. 

  
Important factors, I have **not** changed my detergent, i have **not** changed my deodorant, perfumes, lotions, or anything that i use on a day to day basis.

  
I bought some matcha green tea, had some today, and figured maybe its that, but i had some yesterday and the day prior- no itching, and i hadnt bought it yet during the first 2 instances.

No new medications added, I take birth control (alesse 21) , trazodone, multivitamins, stress cortisol management vitamins, etc



Diet includes: Vegetarian & gluten free

Beans, rice, oatmeal, nut butters, fruits, vegetables, salads, tofu, soups, cheese, etc

  
Daily activities: work out daily, 

  
I do work in the funeral industry, so at first i thought perhaps flowers that im around, but i havent noticed itching on other days, its super random

  
I cannot figure out what can be the cause to this!

Please before you invest in Stonebridge Ventures, please read this article below, you owe it to yourself and your family. You are about to enter a high stakes Poker Game and the deck is stacked against you! Do not invest even a small amount of money. 

This article is so accurate as to what will happen to you and your money. I fell for this scam and I'm not proud of it, I lost a significant amount of money. You will start out with a small amount of money and you will likely grow it through Arbitrage Trades, at the advice of ‚Äúsenior investors‚Äù who make you feel like a loyal customer and  they are just trying to help you grow your funds and they ‚Äúonly make money if you make money‚Äù. Once your account grows you will likely fall victim to investing more as its just to good to be true and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt afford or would be dumb to miss out on this opportunity‚Äù. You will likely lose what‚Äôs invested than you will invest more and you will likely lose that money also but they are always good as being there for you and encouraging you that you can make this back.

Please read the article linked below for the full scam:

"" This particular scam starts with social media ads, most often on Facebook.

They usually feature a photo of a famous Canadian ‚Äî such as the Canadian Prime Minister, the Tesla CEO or a Dragon from. Dragon‚Äùs Den. These endorsements are fake.

The first quality is to win the trust of the victim. To be friends with the victim. It was a rule: make the clients your friends.

Since then it's had time to regrow without any shedding, but it still looks like shit from the thinning that took place from using it. My concern is the hair that shedded will never come back and my hair is just permanently thinned now. I also partly shaved it because I tried dying my hair and I didn't like it, as well as the fact that the shedding got worse after the fact. I assumed that shaving my head down nearly bald would allow those lost telogen hairs to regrow, but it basically hasn't. Even though all these hairs had bulbs at the end. Do I need to wait longer?

I work a second job as a bartender on Saturday nights and on Sundays I spend my time prepping for my primary job as a teacher. I have hardly any money, and there‚Äôs just nothing. There‚Äôs no friends. I can‚Äôt make friends. (Maybe that‚Äôs me issue.) But it just seems so hard when nobody has any time or money to do anything. I live in a small town, there‚Äôs very few things to do that don‚Äôt involve going to a bar and drinking, and that cost a lot of money and there‚Äôs not even Ubers around for everyone to have fun. I am overweight, I am engaged ,and I am pretty ugly, so it‚Äôs not like I can go out to college bars within an hour of me and still hang out. I‚Äôd be turned away at the door.

I‚Äôm a teacher so I have to keep appearances and because of social media I need to make sure I go places where I‚Äôm not seen drinking or having fun- so I can‚Äôt go anywhere within 30 minutes of my job.

‚Ä¢Week 1 it will come and go all day every day only taken pain reliever maybe a few times. 

‚Ä¢Week 2 it‚Äôs still coming and going but I‚Äôm now taking pain reliever every day. I get one spell that takes me out. So light sensitive, nausea. I take ibuprofen it‚Äôs not working. Have to take Tylonal on top to make it go away. It worked. 

‚Ä¢Week 3 I‚Äôm literally taking Tylonal and ibuprofen every day. Trying to keep it only at night so I‚Äôm not over doing it because I know that can cause headaches. Now I have strep. I take an antibiotic for. 

‚Ä¢Week 4 I‚Äôm literally so over it. Meds don‚Äôt work anymore. Now my left ear is full of air and keeps cracking but not pop. Headache spreads across whole head sometimes. I‚Äôm dizzy/dunk feeling when it‚Äôs bad. Vision gets blurry. Seems to get better when I squeeze my head or lay down. 


‚Ä¢Week 5 Now I‚Äôm at the dr finally. They are very confused as much as I am. Ears look fine. I sound fine. Dr does a reflex coordination test on me. Says it must be allergies because I look great. And that if I did have a sinus infection or ear infection the antibiotic I was on for strep would age fixed it. Sends me home on allergy meds , nasal steroids, and gave me a tordol shot to make my head stop hurting. Shot didn‚Äôt work. 

‚Ä¢Week 6 I end up in the ER 2 times because the pain is so unbearable. I get a head CT. They say I have an infected sinus showing no air in my left eyebrow sinus. Give me iv meds to stop pain. Send me home on a different antibiotic. 2 days pass im doing things I need to do in town and it hits me like a train. Im bawling my eyes out in pain meds aren‚Äôt working eyebrow and eye is slightly swollen. Hardly noticeable but you can feel the difference. Back to ER. Give me meds to stop pain. Send me home with a steroid pack. Then my dr calls me with an emergent referral to an ENT. 

‚Ä¢Week 7 I‚Äôm literally going crazy. My ears are both full now constantly. They hurt so bad. I hear my heart beat. I can‚Äôt catch a break. No ER worthy headache since thankfully. 

Now I‚Äôm going to add every single note I‚Äôve taken down to tell all my drs and er of every symptom and thing I‚Äôve tried to get rid of this.

Drake Cannot Win.,CycoPie,2,1cjrlml,KendrickLamar,https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cjrlml/drake_cannot_win/,3,"Just finished my first listen of Family Matters, and‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sorry but like- Drake cannot win. 

Firstly, Drake will never win over the culture, as Kendrick has stated multiple times. Drake continues to miss the points that Kendrick brought up in the previous disses which just shows how Drake panders to his main market of OVO bots who will eat up anything. The allegations, while very very damaging in a battle like this- especially given Kendricks reputation as an uplifting artist and with artistic tracks about and for women- DRAKE DOESN‚ÄôT DELIVER IT CORRECTLY.

 Like bro, you have a huge (unproven) piece of information to ruin a mans reputation, and you don‚Äôt even present it like it‚Äôs important. Just nonchalant the whole time- and gives anyone listening the impression that Drake doesn‚Äôt even believe it himself. And again, the mixed/biracial stuff‚Ä¶ completely misses the point Kendrick is making- and Drakes makes multiple contradictory sounding statements. Did Kendrick wife up a mixed queen? Or did he just play around for the media? And now Kendrick is wrong for not having his son in the public eye? When was the indicative of good parenting? Only reason Adonis is in the public has a lot to do with Drakes insecurity as a parent.

Overall- a very dense record but at the end of the day was not presented well enough imo. Kendrick told y‚Äôall what you were gonna do‚Ä¶ and you went ahead and did it.",05-04-2024,2,0,Discussion
"Ladies, (and gents) I need advice.",TheGildedArcher,1,1cjrlmi,Berserk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Berserk/comments/1cjrlmi/ladies_and_gents_i_need_advice/,0,"So, many of my guy friends and my boyfriend are obsessed with Berserk. They say it‚Äôs their favorite manga and is hands down some of the best writing out there. I‚Äôve looked at Miura‚Äôs artwork and I can‚Äôt deny many of his panels are unrivalled in their detail. I‚Äôm also a lover of anything medieval and fantasy and swordplay is a major part of my life. I‚Äôve drawn darker art before and gore doesn‚Äôt bother me. My boyfriend wants to watch the movies with me, but there is one glaring issue I seem to have with it that none of my guy friends have. The gratuitous r*** of Casca makes me hesitant to read or watch it. When I bring this up they say it‚Äôs just how it was and that Griffith has trauma too. That‚Äôs a fair argument, but seeing the detail of the eclipse panels it made me violently ill. I argue the detail is unnecessary, and that Casca‚Äôs r*** seems to have been done to further Guts‚Äô turmoil. My friends don‚Äôt seem to care too much. And then there‚Äôs apparently something about possessed Guts doing something similar? I understand once but this seems like a lot for one woman. 

Is this a common occurrence in the manga? Are all women treated in such a fashion? What do ladies think of this?

TLDR; My guy friends and my bf love Berserk, but the gratuity of the eclipse bothers me despite my admiration of the world building and art. Should I give it a read anyway? What do female fans think about it?",05-04-2024,1,0,Manga

We spent a lot of time in the airport, because we just met there for the day.  This lady practically ran me over with her luggage.  I moved and I think I apologized for being in the way, even though it wasn't my fault.

He stopped right there and faced me.  Kindly, but firmly, he told me ""don't you ever let anyone push you around.""  It felt caring and protective.  I felt seen.  

It's so hard to understand how this man that was so consistently loving just ghosted me.  I feel like it's my fault, but I don't know what I did wrong.

Three months of silence.  It feels like an eternity.  I miss him so much.  I wish I could be angry, but I'm not.  I just hope he's okay.

How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling

Help out on the lostwaves.org wiki!,nelgix,1,1cjrll0,Lostwave,https://lostwaves.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page,0,"As many of you know, lostwaves.org was announced today as a website by JuicyLegend to facilitate lostwave searches. 

He has also contacted what I believe to be the owner of the ‚Äúlostwaves-finest‚Äù fandom, discussing some kind of collaboration. 

I‚Äôve gotten in contact with JuicyLegend earlier today and I, (as well as one or two other people), am now the main editor and administrator of the lostwaves.org wiki which we plan to grow. 

To do that, we need a group effort. Me and JuicyLegend invite you to come visit the wiki, and help grow it.

You are free to edit and create pages for lostwaves.org, but please do the following:

1. Only talk about relevant things. Irrelevant posts and edits will be removed 

**Example: Do not add information about lostwaves that do not have any prominence.**

All articles must be lostwaves that @user-QLostwave has uploaded to YouTube - it‚Äôs a dumb rule, but this is the criteria we‚Äôre implementing for notability, because there really is no way to measure notability of a lostwave.

2. Ensure your information is accurate, verifiable, and up-to-date.

**Example: Don‚Äôt promote unverified theories of how Jitomate Triste was banned.**

A good idea is to base your articles and edits off of YouTube documentaries of the song.

3. Do not talk about things subjectively. You must be objective and neutral.

**Example: ‚ÄúWaste my time is the best lostwave ever!‚Äù (it is, but we still strive to be neutral)**

4. Be nice

**Example: Edit wars, removing parts of an article for no reason**

All of the above will be subject to a block.
